Irony is No kannadiga will speak about 100 crore rupees given to urdu development by siddaramulla khan
Why South Indians people always fitting for language its just a language to convey msg
These national channels, shame on you. Try to be little sensitive on what you're reporting. No sense
North mein bhi South Indian walon Ko nahin rakhna hoga 😡😡
Datt lodu
Local language nhi ati....why she is posted there....
Why so many North indians in karnataka?
respect local language... Your employer has not forced you to go in other states. You have accepted it. If you don't want to speak local language, resign and sit at home. You must respect local language.  Mind well Hindi is not a National language. In service industry you must speak language of your customers.  Transfer her to North East...
Sorry but if every state does this then there is no unity because there are variations and dialects
Lol India has 100's of languages and even more variations. We can  not learn them all
Branch must have 70 percent regional language staff must because in india Major customer preferred region language only
These kannadigas 😂😂😂 always have problem ,
It's SBI Bank management's mistake. They have to teach the regional languages after posting or should recruit who knows the regional language of the state.
Is it too much to expect a bank employee whos primary job is to serve clints to speak in the local language. The hindi only arrogance shoeld be put in its place. Respect all language, but learn the local requirements.
Ayoo sulle nim amn 😂
Good job sir
Brave lady …. Salute her …. This is India
"It’s not only about language issue, the real thing hidden behind is
A south Indian will be humble in behaviour when living in North India as an excuse of language , work purpose, settlement etc,
But a North Indian will not maintain well behaviour when living in South India moreover behaves as a thugs even though there is a language issue, wants to be more prior than a local person or a local language!"
Seems SBI doesn’t have any commonness in operations, how they can serve the people without-knowing  local language… BAN SBI . Jai Karnataka 🎉
If banks violating RBI rules then bank should be shutdown all iver india right ? What is the purpose of having and following rulez

"Why no one is taking about his statement when he said, “India alri, Karnataka mine”,  which translates to, “not India my Karnataka.” 

I don’t care about language row, but this mindset is dangerous"
I live in Bangalore and have many Kannada friends. They r really very good. However encountered sometime these kind of fanatics but once in a while. Every state has good or bad people but what puzzled me that the guy who is arguing getting more sympathy. This is what politicians want. I dont like or hate a language. Language is just a medium to communicate not a culture. Hope common sense prevails
Keep fighting assholess😂
Dumb 👽 creature destroying whole of it state😂

Virat Kohli has been playing for RCB since 2008, usse bulwa ke dikha kannada 😂😂😂

If you cant speak in local langiage then get out of the state.Dont bring your hindi into our states.
Karnataka 🤡
Please don’t work in karnataka if you can’t assimilate
I think this is the 10th video I'm seeing that some karnataka people torchering other Indian state people to speak only Kannada if we stay there. How shame is this.
close all the sbi branches in karnataka let these suckers beg
Virat Kohli is not playing any role in common man's life. Don't speak non sense.
​ @srinidhik.p6853  so this manager is also not playing any role in common man's life 😂😂😂
All IT industry shifts from karnataka

In the bank applications and withdrawal slips they print local launguages.so they should learn local language. karnataka also in india.bank manager should know and give respect to the local people.
The person is trying to politicise this issue . Its very clear. Rather than asking a solution to his problems he is creating a language war for his video viewership 😂😂
I even dont know kannada,but if u a bank employee u should know local language.because 90 % account will open by local people.other sector we can manage
She s understanding the language and responding No to it.... And y cant she try to speak kannada.... How come she apologised....
This is all divide and rule politics of congress, kannada people are get fooled by Congress politics they being played by congress politician, Bengaluru IT hub became successful because all part of best IT skill Indian are there to make it. Language is a bridge, interpretation skill between people to people, I respect your language and mother tongue, this is not mandatory and forcible to anyone speak the language what you want, this is discrimination basis of language. SBI manager and higher management post of SBI, who manages the financial matter are posted central cadres they are not permanently settled in any one state, in every 2-3 years there locations of posting got changed to reduce risk of financial scams. Every state SBI manager are most of time nearly 60-70% from other states. Diving by Languages and forcing someone to speak a particular language is linguistics discrimination and this is cheap political stunts by congress to gain states power. If every parts of India will do same thing, will you accept when a kannada people travel to other part of India and face of discrimination being reflects of same in there, will you want set that levels.
Arrogant Kannada
If a kannadiga comes to manipur then is it possible to speak manipuri language for that officer? If yes then your arguments are correct.
It's congress and regional parties who fuel issues on religion, language, caste etc. basicially to divide and rule. BJP unites, controls these issues to a very good level. These issues were almost nil in karnataka during bjp govt. Unless common men is influenced by party workers on these hatred topics they stay away from it.

cheap kannad politics..shame on Bangaloreans
I don’t understand after all this years why this language related issue is becoming so much of a concern. I understand if you are staying in a city outside of your hometown you should make effort to learn the local language but it should not be a mandate. Please understand we all are Indians and we have the right to communicate in whatever language we feel comfortable in. Please stop this unnecessary hatred.
Rule of language: If it is easy like English then it is popular accross the globe. If it is easy like hindi then it is popular across India. If it is most difficult language of the world then it will slowly fades like  kannada.
Manager was not harrassed..don't give wrong idea..  she refused to talk or learn or respect the local language.. the state she earning money living and eating .. have respect guys your living in Bangalore.. you learn our language not we learn ur language.. dum
Nahi bolenge kabhi bhi kannad tumhari aukaat hai bol wane ki

What if they go we are not indian ,why u guys want to make mess out of lang....,educated people 😂😂😂Just dont go if u can't respect others ,why forcing hindi on other state
Let him go. Who is crying here ?
Kannada first bullshit. Country first. That man is trying to put her in problem. 😢😢😢.
"Why she is stubborn about hindi ? Hindi is not our official language though, I'm a Bengali i appreciate my Kannadi brothers and sisters about respect and hold their culture and language, South India is full of pride they are religious and they hold their ancient cultures 
I'm hindu, I respect sanskrit, I learned sanskrit but not hindi, 
Hindi is not sanskrit bro, 
This is how Hindi and bihari swallowing our bengali culture 😢, our bengali song bengali culture are full of pride and dignity but bhojpuri destroying them but we bengali are tolarent we suffered but not protest just enduring it

All state has their own pride Language like 
Rajasthan has rajasthani
Maharashtra has marathi 
Bengal has bengali 
Kerala Has Malayalam 
Tamilnadu has Tamil
Andhra has Telegu 
Manipur has manipuri
Asaam has Ahom
All state has their own language so why only hindi will dominate India?? It's not 140cr people mother tongue just remember it

Fully support to kannada people for their possesiveness about their language and culture 
Love from Kolkata ❤❤"
"Mind your own business, if we ever to a bank, we barely speak 4-5 words.. .. Go to that counter, fill this form, write your name and address.. After lunch come tomorrow.. .. That's it.. They don't have to speak full sentence ..  .. .. Arrogant 
Forcing your language will not make your language super famous.. 
I always wanted to learn South Indian language so that I can watch their movies without dubbing.. But their arrogance making me hate them and their language.. If these ppl ever come to North india..  They must learn bengli nepali odia bihari, aadivasi,"
I don't know about the reality behind this. As per my opinion sbi is responsible for this. They should have appoint the manager who has the ability to speak local language or someone with the right skill to adjust this kind of citations 😊😊
We bengalis never forces keralite employee to speak in our language at kolkata. We exchange words in Hindi instead.
Kannada first...❤❤❤
Sh*** k***

I don't think it's bcz of lack of kannadians passing rate less than hindi people. It's about the people in higher position. There are many tamilnadu passed candidate forcefully appointed in bangalore yet many tamil people don't speak English well too. But tamilnadu have more vaccancy but they filled people with hindi people. SBI management and central gvt is the main problem they're just intentionally doing this. That's the purpose of aadhhar. As like tamilnadu CM every south CM should stand for their rights in parliament.
This person knows English well yet creating the nuisance
"Bro thats too much.  We love kannada language 
    but dont do like this"
Thank god she got transferred. Being kn Karnataka you have to respect our language.
"If that person doesn't know English, Then He's somehow right as he is facing difficulties in Customer Services. But he knows English. When the SBI official told ""I'll never speak Kannada."", Immediately He understood and translated that one to Kannada. Then Why he was forcing the Official to speak in kannada... Just for satisfying his EGO.
I have also worked in Karnataka for 4 years. 99.99% people in Karnataka behave very well to Bank official, that to be speaking in Hindi or English. They ask which language you prefer.
One dead Fish can spoil the whole Pond."
She could have told him. I will try to learn in future politely .. problem solved
What about these south indian people जब ये north india में आते है और टूटी फूटी हिंदी बोलते है यहां लोग उन्हें आदर देते है क्योंकि उन्हें इंग्लिश आती है अगर इस व्यक्ति को मातृ भाषा बोलवाना था तब ये खुद इंग्लिश क्यों बोल रहा है। इंग्लिश को तो हीन भावना से नहीं देख रहे । अगर ऐसा है तो किसी भी south indian ko north india me nahi aana चाहिए उन्हें भी हिंदी और मातृ भाषा बिल्कुल नहीं आती सिर्फ इंग्लिश जानते है इस बुनियाद पर वो यहां क्यों eligible है😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
Hindi is a mixture of Arabic, parsian, urdu, Aryan and other invaders languages but Dravidians languages are very old and pure languages. 😂

There should be one Nation one language policy
"Local language first respect the local language people who are belonging from other state should tell politely that they are trying to speak native language but provisionally can they speak the language for understanding.
Other state people can't force the native people that they Speak in Hindi"
"This is not the full video. In the full video, first the customer is informed that she does not know Kannada, but still he keeps pushing & heckling the lady to speak in Kannada, so the lady changed her tone from ""I dont know Kannada"" to ""I wont speak Kannada"" to ""I will never speak Kannada"" after getting irrirated.
Most of the Kannadigas are referring to the last 2 words, completely ignoring the provocation initiated from the customer. This is really horrible. Same thing happened with playback singer ""Sonu Nigam"" while in concert in Bangalore. Some pro-kannada members were heckling & threatning to sing in Kannada."
please govt post their known language state
SBI should give training of politeness to their employees first
She should be posted in remote kannada village branch ... She will learn automatically
This kannada saar not INDIAAA SARRR NO HINDII SARRR!!!!🙏🙏

"Bilkul sahi kiya madam ney
South indians pata nahi indians kyu hey"
This man came bank fr his services or to promote his mother language. This man is a educated fool living in union of states india
Arrogant officer transferred, SBI says zero tolerance for such arrogant behavior and starts kannada classes 1 hours every week , makes mandatory to talk and respect customers who speak kannada and provide service in kannada, and SBI has agreed to be more inclusive in customer service in kannada, nodal kannada officer will be in all zones for implementation of kannada in SBI banks across Karnataka , more kannada candidates will be recruited,
Her last punch is nice, I will never speak Kannada.. Brave woman..
Does this happens in any of the developed countries in West?
"This is a very small case. The SBI official should be put under Language Sensitivity Training. That's it. Story over. Simply politicians have started using this for their TRP.

Karnataka politicians are keeping the locals in the dark by making them indulged in these language wars. All are busy in imposing language. Nobody questions the poor infrastructure, metro incomplete from last 14 years, worst road conditions, basic traffic lights not there in major junctions like Kadubeesanahalli, Attibele, Chandapura, etc., increasing crime rates, increasing cost of living, increasing cases of molestation on ladies, etc. The only picture shown to us is LANGUAGE and the rest all is blurred to the Karnataka public."
boycott hindi dubbed movie ⚔️⚔️⚔️
I was shocked that SBI bank has such an uneducated idiotic manager that she has no capacity to learn my kannada launguage she should be thrown out of our state . SBI has to  look after it and throw this bleady manager out of service and sbi
All that dumbass woman needed to show was some humility that's all
"Kannada kannada😊 tamil😊 hindi 😊it's going on the way...

He don't know kannada 😅

You think your are one and only -mental🤡🤣"
These kannadas never speak in Marathi while in Mumbai
FOR YOUR KIND INFORMATION hInDi is not official national language of Bharat.
FARMER HARASSED BY BANK MANAGER.I am from a small town in Karnataka where most of the customers of SBI are from rural areas and mostly farmers who can't speak a single word of Hindi. Most the SBI employees are from Hindi belt. These poor farmers localities have to beg the security guard and peons to translate for them. She could have just deescalated by being professional but she chose to be arrogant. Hindi is to India what English is to the world. it's not mandatory.
thats not the way to treat a customer..suspend her
No bank manager in tamil nadu is appointed wothout knowing tamil. This is unfair in karnataka SBI should be given fresh guidelines by RBI.
"Women behaved bad … no need to go that direction .. should be punished 

But the cash you got from bank or  ATM from Kannada  is it written or printed in Kannada too ?"
Boycott Karnataka, we support India. Hindi common language medium of communication. Punjab, haryana, UP, Bihar, Calcutta, kashmir, Chhattisgarh, Telangana, Ap, Maharashtra every one has regional language. You and Tamilnadu people are adamant regional feeling. Now entire India will boycott. You are also like Pakistan for free bus you elected joker CM. Know your status😂😂😂😂. India first other wise learn Urdu get ready to become minority.
Make English the national language. Problem solved
SBI Manager is rude and definitely needs training about communication with customer. she should put apology. Typical north indian victim. respect kannada culture.  I am from Maharashtra
Clearly shows education doesn't give you common sense and kindness but character does
Sbi is rogue
Don't work outside karnataka  😂😂😂😂😂😂 ok learn to speak hindi  which is  most spoken language  In india  if u want work in MNC or use English
"Which part u r living...
There r so many kannadigas living inside mumbai and pune...
90%-95% use marati language outside.. And kannada in home..."
​ @dnbpedvk6204 in gujarat, people bully south indians as Africans 😅😅😅😅
I am a Kannadiga. But I agree to you, they should speak. The local people should ask them to speak in Marathi.
The great  Bhimsen Joshi spike Marathi and he was a  musician and a Kannadiga. So was Gangubai Hangal. All Kulkarnis are Kannada speaking but speak marathi very well.
​ @srinidhik.p6853 when kannada maids join non kannada homes, they should ask if owner can speak in kannada then only they'll work 😅😅😅
learn english.... first get raid of hindi in maharastra, then come and speak...
It is there problem  even indian constitution is officially written in English   thay should learn  officially language
"Its not about language...
Most of marati and kannadigas are frustrated because of these north indians culture, bad attitude, over smartness with zero knowledge, dirty words often used by them in routine conversation in official area, their pub culture, their exposive dressing sense...."
ask her to resign....
Don’t open your account in Nationalized bank, if you know only kannada open account in regional branch.
Problem is her attitude not language. Change your caption "Not SBI manager harassed, SBI manager insults Kannada language"

SBI must be Privatized"
I am Marathi from Maharashtra I full saport in kanadda person
This is India. But na na kannada firstu 😂😂
That lady manager needs to give respect to other languages
If you have an issue go get educated learn English and then argue
"Supaarr madam saaar...supaaarrr 😂😂
These  people can neither speak english properly nor Hindi 😂😂"
if this continues..then the best solution is to free all states from Indian union.
"Will these people not go under medical treatment in case of Medical Emergency ???

Will they demand not to get Medical Treatment, if the doctor doesn't speak kannada???"
Languages in the southern part of India are tough. I used live in bangalore and i tried to learn..but the words are so tough..I am from northeastern part of India. People should understand that some languages are tough..
We Indians are patriotic✅ We Indians are pathetic ✅ We both🤡
Hindi arrogance Vs Kannada arrogance ITS WAR TIME
Let's Boycott canada movies
Dont.... Do.... This.... 😡
North indians never use their common sense it seems as this clearly says that both of them can able to communicate in english well better they can communicate in english why this lady is demanding him to speak in hindi only its so arrogant behaviour and use some common sense you are not in your own state as you migrated to other state you should surely and compulsory to know whether the regional language or english otherwise you will be treated like this only she deserves it if she will speak only in hindi means better let her go to north india dont come to south india bank in karnataka is serves for people of karnataka not for other states so its important for them to know their regional language first even small kiddo can understand this problem easily but north indians never understand this rather they will think how we can problems on south india? How we can bring clash between religions? How we can make every think worse? Even we south indians are also treated so badly in north india but we never complaint all this as an lkg childrens
I think tamilnadu should take initiative that if people from other states are settling or working here for a longer period of time they should learn tamil compulsorely otherwise no jobs will be given for north indians in tamilnadu and even north indians follow this policy if we south indian goes to north india means we have a compulsory agreement and they selecting only the candidates who know hindi language but we south indians are leaving all the north indians as it is 😮 people of north india are taking advantage on that this should take an action immediately
"Who invited u to southern part
."
Ya, we agree. But there is a way to tell that right ? She is behaving very rudely with him.
Yaa
Why she is comming to karnataka?? Tell me if she is comming to karanataka means try to respect the regional language lol only give respect and take respect otherwise no respect from our side😅
Im a tamilian its our right that its our state that we will speak only in our regional language if you will come to south india and respond only in hindi means better dont come to south india and create problems here better stay in north india itself 😅
I agree with the customer decision, SBI should respect locals for the sake of the locals. That girl is arguing to speak in Hindi in their state, this girl and eventually the entire system imposing hindi.
Dfks why do you go to banks? To take language classes? Do your job and bug off. If she can't speak the language ask someone who can speak to help you and move on. Nonsense
Kannada man is right .
people here are not getting the context.. my parents doesnt understand english or hindi.. They go to bank  and manager talks in hindi checkbook in hindi and english? What are they suppose to do? A midway solution is to hire some translators.
There is no shortage of idiots in India ...
"An officer transfers from one place to another and travels to various places, please guys don't expect someone to tell your native language, get the service what you need from the organization and public officer. Language should not be an obstacle for anyone both way.
Also I urge SBI madam to speak politely that you don't know the language people can help with you hindi or english.
*staying in a particular state and art we shall not be greedy towards its native language that I'll not speak for sure, its an insult to the people of that state, madam you could have managed it in the other way being the Manager.
Rest I urge both parties to stay calm and don't escalate this issue further."
If a Marathi SBI Manager started offering  services in Marathi to his customer in North India will the bhaiyyas be comfortable ?? No. Similarly we Non Hindi states are not comfortable with Bimaru Hindi. Employees should offer services in the language of customers.
But if you do not know the regional language, there should a link language.Stop being so childish and act as mature human beings
"Nation is  first.. not state..  Diversity is our Rich heritage and boon , lets not make it a bane by fighting among ourselves...


But here its clearly SBI's fault they must Facilitate custome in their regional language."
As an employee learning local language is important and necessary that is why sbi clerk exam conducted LPT test.
Average tenure of sbi posting is 2 years, so if she works for 30 years she needs to learn 15 languages over and above her daily work. Lets not let the logic go south(pun intended)
Theses hindivalas are becoming second pakistanis in India...
Only English can solve this problem as it is equally foreign to everyone, most elite customers speak English only. But rural India do not know English.
Common sense is not common for Hindi-belt! They are still living under neurotic behaviour like thinking India means Hindi.
Stop hindi imposition
Throw out such customers. She was speaking in English but that man is not even listening to her. If you don't speak any other language other than your regional one then take someone with you to the bank who can understand other languages atleast English.
In maderxhodo m himmat ho to wk bar maszid se Arabic men daily 5 bar bhokne walo ki bol k bata de ki azan Kannada me Karo, inki amma khud jaygi
Kannadigas make a big deal about their language. They cannot enforce the language on people. They can request but it is up to the people to oblige.
Exactly
Definitely ❤
She have to learn the local language to customer
I'd probably just faint listening to her squealing
These street Neta type wants to become the leader of India, strict action should be taken for such items
CUSTOMER IMPORTANT NOT A LANGUAGES
For vote bank politics people are divided base on religion, region and language.
Being a resident of andaman and nicobar islands is a blessing to me.
All North Indian should go back to their developed states of UP and Bihar if theu do not respect South culture and language.
What the security guard doing? He should not allow someone to enter to private cabin.
Hey If you dont know kannada than manage or allow him to speak with deputy or Assit Manager who knows kannada or assign him to some other person to deal a issue.. simply making nonsense without sense as a manager needs to manage but here the manager becomes like arrogent manager
My lowda india, long live seperate Dravida Nadu
There should be no offence to local language at the same time you can't force anyone to speak in your local language. This is the beauty of this country. Unity in diversity.
Koi RBI ka aisa rule ni hai anpadh gawaaro.. Officers ka transfer 2-3 saal me ho jata hai iske liye Regional language learne krenge? Ye condition Clerical me hai jo frontlime staff hote hain...Jo statewise hota hai.. Officers ko ni sikhna hota... Kuch pta na ho to bs RBI- RBI kr do.. Officers k poore service condition me kahi ni hai Local language sikhna.... Aur jo aadmi English smjh raha hai usko bhi bank me apna kaam ni kraana..sirf halla machaana hai...kannad kannad krna hai.....bhai jo ladaayi krne ke iraade se aaya hai wo to ladaayi hi krega..usko ni smjha skye..baaki illiterate logo ki baat jaha tk rhi jo Hindi English dono ni smjh skte to  State Gramin bank me account open kraao..... Ye sb drama Maharashtra se start hua.. Aur ab saare states sb kuchh chhod kr bs language ki ladaayi lad rhe hain.. Govt. is silent.... This is very ridiculous 👎

Such idiots just divide us instead of uniting us. These things give an edge to terrorists and other countries just to put their foot on us"
Sale haram jade if u will come to north side what language  you will prefer...to speak for  communicate.
"My language Telugu but 
Indian language Hindi ✅"
Godi media... How can you say it's harassing? Is asking to talk in local language to public service manager harassing?
This lady should not have  this much arrogance
Nothing to do with language, it’s abt mutual respect, everyone should speak regional but by abusing someone we will only irritate them… promote the language with mutual respect and love..,
Her behaviour was atrocious. This is not how a manager behaves. Take up the issue with the Chairman.
But when pehalkam attack took place they did not ask their language but only religion- stay united don’t get trapped into language politics.
Culprit is SBI, controlled by Modi who wants to create problem in Non-BJP ruled states, so that people of the country do not question Modi and remain busy with these matters.
Unfortunately, what’s wrong in accepting humans the way they are than taking about caste, regional language. All bull shit. At the end of the day language can’t fetch you moral values
Whatever u guys said Everything is right, regional govt. body should speak native language . But this language battle is going on for no reason it's only political agenda, have u ever seen any muslims fighting over language.. no, since it's a way to divide us by political parties nd unnecessary people.. wake up stay united
This is a disgrace. Shame on all politicians for fanning such hatred. Congratulations to all politicians for dividing India.
If this is India as she said and why Hindi
"The matter is very very simple the SBI Manager can say I don't know to speak kannada I can speak Hindi and English. If you still need assistance in Kannada i can ask someone from my cader to help you with your queries.

First of all respect the people, language and culture wherever you stay either India (States) or abroad.

I don't find any resistance from Indians in Germany, France, Italy, Japan etc. There even they will bow down to learn their language for jobs. Why you guys do such things in India !!"
Bhai vo sbi mei hai uska transfer all India kahi bhi ho sakta hai.kya har bar vo language sekhegi kya english mei bat krlo
https://youtu.be/Cmzac97POy4?si=ZoPPnIeEwSKagcQY
Then don't transfer people from other states.
You said super is that kannada
I don’t know why these Hindi people have that superiority complex? Other states have to fund their poor states and must speak their language. What nonsense? I wonder how princely states agreed to join this bullsh*t union. There were no visionaries? This is fu*king forcefully held union just like Soviet Union. It will meet the same fate. Seriously, who lives with this ungrateful people? Their only pride is they produced population like pigs so that they can assume power.
App log nonsense issues leke baithna
Bere  Kela ivnapppa?  Kannada  abhimana  irabeku, athirekha  beda
This is an unnecessary dispute if purpose is solved let's do it but it is forced to talk about any specific language in India is not good, we must be united.
Kannada is not easy language to learn it takes time until then allow her
Definitely we can not unite until the hindi imposition is stoped.
Till that time we dont do any bank work is it?
India will not be developed country because of so many languages
Respect regional languages. Nobody ask u to speak their language at first. But when u say why we should speak then every one defend their language. Dont show ur attitude with local ppl. Atleast she could have told will learn.
Yeh Aadmi kuch kar nahi paya hoga jindagi main tu socha local hero bunkar lad hee loon, strong and successful people never fight for such petty things😂
It's rule that non-native officers should pass native language test.
Arrogance of manager....dont have to be so rude and say i wont speak local language. pick up local people for these posts or people who  have proficiency in local language and culture.dont hurt local sentiments and language.
People are really creating a new sense with language as a preference.there is a way to convince people to speak language you should not make people develop hate towards language.we should be focused on outcome not on fighting.im not telling what that lady did is write but i can also convince her to speak Kannada.please focus on outcome .thus kind of behaviour is really developing hatred towards language.
Get her transferred to Bihar
It's known thing that everyone cant learn a language, but she could have managed it politely even though customer behaves like an idiot whi expects everyone to speak kannada, these people dont know others life struggles, shes being fron other state customer could have shown shown some empathy,,but she arguing over it not right,,,she could have told atleast politely "ok sir, ill try to learn"" matter would have been calmly ended
Just speak english which everone understands.Our country has way more problems other than some language.
If KANNADIGAS really has guts in BUTS tell.this to the whole IT SECTOR ....TELL THE SAME THING TO AMERICAN BUSINESS ASSOCIATES ..WHO COME TO BANGALORE AND SIGN MILLIONS DOLLARS DEALS .... COMPLETE BANGALORE INFRASTRUCTURE IS BUILD BY OUTSIDER.....FUCKING WHAT KANADA WHAT HINDI ...WE ALL SHOULD COOPERATE WITH EACH OTHER

SBI kick her out of karnataka
In hyderabad all karnataka people should speak telugu and in nepal you guys should speak Nepali... other wise you guys should leave our states....
If SBI employee cant communicate in local language to their customer who are locals then why have a branch, establishment should with employee friendly and they expecting local customer to speak in english. Classic SBI as always harrash customers
Please visit Bank of Maharastra city market branch in Bengaluru. Not even one staff member speaks in Kannada there...
Don't judge a man until you've walked a mile in his shoes.Dont transfer bank employee in  every 5 years .
should complaint to rbi
Kick this arrogant lady out from the state
Can't they both just speak english
No problem when kanndinga comes to Maharashtra they aught to speak in Marathi 👍
zero balance🤣
But handi speaking people donot give respect for local language and wantbto break the nation
Exactly... Makes it so simple.
Lets say a elder woman knows kannada all her life suddenly is asked to speak in english. That is so easy right!
In Almost  all states in India not everyone know English. Shes appointed by the bank so she can learn the respective language or make a colleague assist her  like a translaterin conversation with the customer
"Saara Zamana language ka ho Gaya hai Deewana 😂😂😂

If each state spoke a language other than their own, that would be fantastic."
When a kid is made a manager ! Stupid manager must be fired for arguing with a customer.
Respect regional languages
Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil state have lot of issue with their native language, but dose their Govt ask before collecting Tax if they know local language, dose the govt ask before collecting stap duty on property & rental deeds that if u know local language you can stay, while collecting money there is no language barriers but while doing day to day routine work language is barrier,
She shud have used English instead of Hindi..this what others feel language imposition...😅
She is right ✅️ india first
These fanatics are harming more... Everyone go and support this branch... Fools like him are dividing ppl... It's becoming a fashion to fight and ppl will say that they will not speak if forced...
If you are in Karnataka respect Kannada; if you cannot speak, be humble; if you feel free to go back to UP
I think this sbi manager should be transferred if she is not even considering to learn local languages
Banking employee must know regional language because majority of customers don't know English
She is indecent.  Everyone should respect their state language.
Not language war.. it is self-respect!
Do you know how hard its for someone to talk in Hindi or English when the only language they know is kannada.. especially poor farmers who have taken loans??
"It is a customer service issue portrayed as language war😅😅😅.
If south guy in North says talk in english or my language does it makes customer service issue or language issue 😅😅😅"
Banks are public service so banks should make sure their employees can communicate in local languages
Regional language first
More like telugu 😂😂
Tamil be like, maathadu maathadu maligai x3
Arrogant attitude is not good..Good that she was kicked out of SBI. Atleast she would have spoken politely with the customers and told she doesnt know how to talk in Kannada.
Speak in a language where both parties can understand.  Please dont force 🙏
That is wrong! I know lot of people who dont know english. How would they communicate?
She is wrong, Regional Language must be an option
Nobody is interested in learning your jalebi language. Why are you forcing it on us.
Yetthangdi aitu
You people are illiterate
He is an indecent broo... Why should she speak in kannada.. it's not her fault to do the job in Karnataka. The management transferred her so she is doing her duty
First respect the national language Hindi
"​ @Gamer_Boyz_007  kis ne bola ki hindi national language h.
Thoda sa padai pe focus karo fir comment karo"
"​ @Gamer_Boyz_007 
Where in India constitution it is written that hindi is national language.
?"
😂😂 National language??? For which country?? ​ @Gamer_Boyz_007 
​ @ajithchandran7402   Hindi is a global language. Even neighbouring countries like afghanistan, nepal, pakistan, bangladesh etc can speak and understand Hindi. Your local language is isolated to just one state. Nobody is interested in learning your language. Don't force your local language on us.
​ @Gamer_Boyz_007  So it's better Government appoints locals
​ @Gamer_Boyz_007 😂hey fool Tamil is the national language of india. So learn tamil
​ @ajithchandran7402  pakistan
TRUE
Official language hai hindi bhai.........
Join Hindi speaking classes
​ @Gamer_Boyz_007  yo a farmer can't afford Hindi class..he is making sure you have rice on the table..
​ @stick2roots  It's free. You can also join
Exactly
National language Hindi first
​​ @Gamer_Boyz_007 oh Man Hindi is not a national language, somebody please educate this northies.. just fyi Hindi is just a official language of unions,like for parliament
Why do these guys force people to speak kannada? 😢
Saalo pahalgam me language pe shouting huva kaya
Saar we are educated saar 😂
"India vs Pakistan ❌

Indian states vs indian states ✅"
They transferred her for these racists. Imagine her children and her family situation. 😢 This is cruel.
This way any small interest to learn local language will fade in no time replacing it with feelings of resentment
This is reason I left bangalore years ago 😂 Racism ✅ Try Kerala they are always excited to speak Hindi 😂
I will pay this Patriotic Bank Manager 20k from my salary 🙏🇮🇳❤️ Respect
Atleast mutual respect is missing from employees as well. Why they are getting offended when asked to speak kannada? Sure il learn will do simply. Seems like most of hindi speaking people are trying to be specially treated. Respecting nativity is always good.
Its ok to not know Kannada. If you try to learn its great, if not atleast be polite about it while you are in Karnataka. All phones have translator app, use it atleast. Kannadigas are flexible, if someone tries a little bit, they also try. No person can impose Hindi here.

Banks’ Front Desk Must Know Local Language: Sitharaman"
Not all can speak Kannada say a Tamilian who comes to KA might not be knowing likewise, a North Indian also might not be able to catch up to the speed to learn Regional Language, and space/time should be given and for simple reasons that Manager wasn't able to talk in Kannada people shouldn't make noise. Yes if Manager didn't support/cooperate and wasn't able to provide the required services then the customer can raise his voice for poor service else it looks very childish to have these kind of activities. Very sad KA/TN always fighting for Cauvery water, now started with Local Language supremacy this will boil down to the core but not given any permanent fix that's why Hindi should be welcoming across India. Sanskrit is the best suitable Language. Telugu/Kannada are Twin Languages and in Hyderabad never these kind of instances are seen for that matter even in Vizag/Vijayawada of AP cities that's why Hindi is "Business Language" of India and this Tamilians always oppose seeing them Kannadigas are as well doing it which isn't healthy sign, Telugu people are Adorable across North India in Kasturi Kannada, and in TamilNadu reason being Andhra People are Polite/Humble people "Jai Hind"
This language shit is unnecessary.
The Cleaner Lady also tried to pour fuel to the argument but to FAIL. INDIA has bigger problems and these guys are arguing for language barrier.
She is arrogant that she is beautiful and educated
India first maka😂😂
Regional language has to be Respected !
As a tamilian if you will speak and respond only in hindi means better dont come to south india sit in north india itself😌 if you have problem in speaking kannada means you can communicate in english right why you north indians are expecting the south indians to speak hindi even i know the kannadigas behaviour they are not rude but the people make them rude if you dont know hindi or any other language better communicate them in english they will respond and even im tamilian working in bangalore even i also face language problem and due to english i somehow survived in karnataka and i got proffession and settle in karnataka i learnt kannada language their no one imposed me to learn kannada and the language war is created by north indians and blamming us as if we created this problem it 😅
"I have  2 sim cards and the one linked to my sbi account is only receiving scam messages for updation of KYC .

People should speak your language with love not by forcing them.
Because you are in karanataka 😂
because they know only kannada. They dont understand any other language.
Common sense vs Unreasonable
Be there in Kerala
If if have so much hate for local languages then we also don't want Hindi, simple
Yeah, much better pay and better life in Gurgaon, Haryana Cybercity without Racism.
​ @azhageshm6768 I have no hate for Kannada Language ❌ It's a language of my nation and I have only honour that such a language exists 🇮🇳 I Hate The People That Abuse Others and Force them to speak Kannada. ✅
​ @azhageshm6768  Don't be a fool and fight for petty reasons. Respect your nation and stand united as an Indian 🇮🇳 India has 121 languages and 200+ mother tongues. If we are to fight over such petty issues then we will have nothing to call our Bharat 🇮🇳
"Bhai ur state budget is being paid by karnataka tax...

You are against the diversity of this country and talking about patriotism.
Its impossible to be such dimwits, i suspect you two comments have other intentions to spread hate and divide Indians.
Oooo teach ur Hindi walad
Then why is bjp forcing south Indian states to learn Hindi?
Then teach your northies to speak in regional language
​ @nachigowda07 bjp is not forcing anyone to learn Hindi ,I'm from rss and mad mad hindu only and we too know hindi but we don't want to speak Hindi inside Karnataka,
​ @ajithchandran7402 for your information sir central govt recently is forcing Tamil Nadu to include Hindi in the govt school syllabus or else they will take away some of the funding
He is not demanding people, he is asking a person who is a manager of a bank which is in Karnataka and we should give service in Kannada.
He is not demanding people, he is asking a person who is a manager of a bank which is in Karnataka and we should give service in Kannada.
These proud kannadigas themselves won't talk to other people from Karnataka in Konkani , Tulu and Coorgi. Other than their native tongue, they too  should also learn Kannada coz of these hooligans.
She must speak in Kannada. North Indians must behave themselves and not act like goondas. This is South India and not your goonda North India ..u have to speak in local language and you cannot insist on Hindi here ..I hope SBI will transfer her to her native goonda North India place.
If u can’t speak in Kannada don’t live in Karnataka leave the state. India is only a culmination of different states. I should not feel ashamed to speak in my mother tongue, it’s as good as putting ur mother to shame.
Useless fellow
Wow such brain dead comments, what if some local villager walks in and doesnt know hindi? Regional language is prio in services provided to people off that specific state / region cuz they simply wont understand other languages. Language is only a tool for communication use the one that is needed. People taking sides are equally at fault as the other cuz they lack respect for their own and the other.
Suspend that SBI idiot....
Everyone cannot communicate in Hindi or English .. these jobs  we’d lots of communication , better these are reserved w.r.t language
This will certainly lead to a language war.
Sbi sir, what u did is good job.. there are companies who rule that only they has to sustain in certain MNC saying we are north Indians.. especially a company where all management is north Indians .. they r only need to sustain over there.. in that case what u did is 100% right this lady understand kannada and nodding head for all things why can't speak in kannada
Once goes to another state the person should be able to talk to in the local language
we are all divided and so will remain for next 100000 years
If she can understand kannada can't she speak kannada
The manager is right there is not necessary for speaking regional language for officer cadre and the man behind this camera show how intentionally humiliate this Manager please take a strick action against this man. Thats why officers were posted anywhere in India.
If this is india then speak why speak only hindi ..
He is an Idiot
The state govt is doing nothing to kannadigas. Shame on the govt?
What kind of service theyll provide with this kind of attitude? Why are they imposing hindi on us?
Oh god..How insane 😮
Customer is clearly uneducated.. that’s what he is trying to say
Only Mallus respect all languages. they try to learn other languages and doesn't show too much patriotism towards thier language.
"Action was taken against this lady who is called Priyanka. She has been asked to go in leave and had been transferred. SBI are in a damage control
Mode. The CM has also intervened. This man is our hero. We need more like him. We want more folks who give good customer service and not rowdy officers like this woman who has this arrogance of “ janta hey bey ki mera balatkari Goonda Khooni goonda baap aur khandaan kaun hai! Hindi mein baat karo”.  If you go we the locals will slap you but don’t play the victim card."
No. The lady is arrogant. in service industry you must respect your customers and their language. If you don't know the language, there are ways to inform.  Bank staff has to be polite always. You can't shout at the customers and I am not from Karnataka
If she talks politely it's no longer an issue!
Then why did this rowdy manager Priyanka get transferred??? She also gave a public apology. SBI was s in damage control mode as we speak. So what are you talking about! If he is uneducated why are the locals behind him giving him all the support and painting the face of this lady black???
 @EshAnian-q5o that everyone knows why she is transferred.. it’s because.. public pressure decides the ultimate law.. it was political pressure..
We can never progress with this mindset.. small issues are considered big and bigger issues are ignored..
 @EshAnian-q5o also by calling a bank manager rowdy for doing her job.. you are showing up your high standards..
Harassed??? 😂😂😂 Who is harassing whom?
there is an RBI rule that in that particular state you must speak the respective language 💥
This ☝️ Language 😭 thing is Becoming a JOKE 🤣 no 1 has the Right to tell anyone what language to talk this is causing Fights every where PLEASE 🙏 STOP 🛑 This ☝️ Behaviour or CLOSE your Account in the BANK 🏦🏧 if your not Satisfied 🙏😞
People are loosing mind.
both are idiots.. both know english and hell bent on arguing... ego issue .. no language issue here
Kaam baam kucch nahi karna, jo bichare bank mein kaam karte hai unko pareshaan karo.. .. caste se baat nahi banti toh language ka votebank banayega "secular" party wala...
Regional language of the state must be treated with respect and priority.
"We r so much educated 😂😂 that we can be still ruled by Foreigners.. and slowly Peacefuls are engulfing us.
U speak kannada or Marathi or any language.. we will have one language the day entire India is declared Islamic country unfortunately"
Idiots
People need to learn local language wherever they settle.  Within reasonable time
hindi speakers dividing hindus by imposing hindi on South Indians
No other states in entire country cause more trouble in name of language except Tamilnadu, Karnataka.
@cnnnews18 first report properly. According to RBI rules she has to provide services in local language which is kannada. Instead she's arrogant in her behaviour and totally unprofessional & not customer friendly. Is this the training she'd have received?
Need Govt should intervention on such serious issue bcoz SBI is running from brahmins cartel so before any raise of strikes against SBI accross country need to reform
You people are making fun of your language, if you are forcing someone to speak your language. Your language is very weak that you need to force people to speak your language
Specially SBI  should hire locals not others who don't know regional language and culture.
He himself is speaking in English … talking in English is fine Wow
"How dare she say cannot talk in kannada, she should try to learn kannada. This people come from outside and want harase kannda people. Let her go back to her place. 
People should wake up."
Throw her out of her work, such a rude animal she is
Religion, language, caste is the the last straw for all scoundrels😮
The bank manager harassed her customer. Now she is gone after apologies. SBI is in damage control mode.
That would mean learning the local language of every state, even though I'm only staying for 6 months. It takes atleast 2 years to learn a language.
I belong to the army family and we transfer after 4 or 3 years it's impossible to learn the local languages. Even though I have lots of South Indian friends, we communicate easily
​ @ashishmaske5336  Exactly. The whole point of a universal language is for people like us who have to shift regularly, to still be able to communicate. Can you imagine if every damn state started sponsoring their language so violently like this.
Have one common Dravidian language, similar to Hindi like tamil or something that will help anywhere in South of India
​ @rajanlad  okay tamil isnt similar to 'any other language of the south of india'...eg. tamil - telugu aren't similar like Bengali - assamese. Secondly YES WE DO HAVE A COMMON LANGUAGE ITS NAME IS HINDI
​ @pokemaster0645  that's kinda my point. Dravidian languages cam have one common language as hindi is for in north. Cause south constantly see it as imposition and since learning each language is pointless. This can be a bargain.
​ @rajanlad ohhh now I understand your point 😅
Respect my a*s*s, I am not interested in learning your local language. Period
She never disrespected the language. On the other hand the customer disrespected the official & caused the scene.
 @film-masti-777 Hindi deserves the disrespect. Why should the non Hindi speakers speak or learn Hindi.
 @rajanlad no single language in the south. Learn the local language.
 @pokemaster0645 if you have to learn each of the local languages because you are a bird of flight it’s your problem. Why should the locals learn a language that you are comfortable in ? WTF are you?
​ @EshAnian-q5o  so when get a job opportunities in north India, are you willing to learn 10+ native languages fluently by yout logic
 @EshAnian-q5o  Noone is forcing you to learn anything. but dont try to impose any verdict on others what shud they learn or not learn because of your personal discontent towards Hindi.
​ @EshAnian-q5o  the entire country has agreed to learn a common language for the sake of communication (hint: it's Hindi) Heck the entire world has agreed on a common international language to communicate properly (hint: it's English). I'm comfortable in Bengali, I'm not asking anybody to learn it. What if I'm a bird of flight, because my job asks me to be one? Isn't it really unfair then to ask me to learn each local language just so I can communicate? But okay, I'll agree to learn, but it's not easy learning a language either. Especially if I'm posted only for a handful of months. Look, no local language has to fade to obscurity because day to day communication is happening in a national language or an international language. You need to learn to preach your culture less aggressively.
 @pokemaster0645 that’s your personal pain point. Why should we the locals care?
 @rajanlad just because you bloody pariah bastards can’t navigate why should we oblige you? If you suffer by coming fuel south suffer. It’s your pain. Why should we care???
 @pokemaster0645 common language Hindi my bloody foot 🦶. We in the south won’t learn it. It’s not our language.
​ @EshAnian-q5o  then don't cry if us people from all around india refuse to learn YOUR language. We won't. Talk in english or leave. Negotiation comes from sides
​ @EshAnian-q5o  because we want to communicate with you. We want to learn your language eventually, but that kind of stuff takes time. If you 'locals' come barging into the shops demandinv local language yet not bothering to switch counters, then there's nothing much we can do
 @pokemaster0645 how many languages you must learn is your pain point. Why should we locals learn a language of your choice. WTF are you.
​ @pokemaster0645  you are wrong brother if you are interested to learn you can learn in one month okay...... Tumko 2 year lagega tho thu ek no ka fool 😂😂😂😂
She never disrespected Kanada. It was the other guy who disrespected the Women. He could have requested politely instead of making drama .
tell this thing to IAS and IPS then you understand you people only create problem to common people
I belong to the army family and we transfer after 4 or 3 years it's impossible to learn the local languages. Even though I have lots of South Indian friends, we communicate easily
"​ @ashishmaske5336     I said those who settle down at a place.  Are you buying a property, settling down in each place you go?  Then?  Also, what percentage of immigrants are Army personnel?  Then why bring up your example?

It is not only about being able to communicate.  It is about preservation of different cultures"
Is this a constitutional necessity? How have you so freely decided this necessity ?
​ @lakshmisubramanian9233     Is brushing teeth constitutional necessity?  Is common sense not good enough?
​ @rajasekhark8333  Yeah good point. Hope you would be willing to develop some common sense.
​ @lakshmisubramanian9233    Isn't it clear who needs common sense?  I made a point.  You asked for Constitutional necessity when it requires just common sense to understand it.
​ @rajasekhark8333  What explanation will be receptive to a person who draws parallels to rule of law and basic hygiene. I can see where you come from. Be happy with your fanatic ideologies. Bye
​ @lakshmisubramanian9233      "Rule of law"?  Did I ever say my suggestion was a rule?  Do you do everything only as necessitated in the Constitution?  Analogy was to make you understand everything cannot be only by Constitution.  Couldn't understand the analogy also!  Is saying "one needs to learn a language" fanaticism?  Where do you come from?  And which school did you go to, if at all?  Anyway, I know common sense doesn't get taught in any school.
​ @rajasekhark8333 if you want to preserve your language you speak with your ppl, write books.. Why forcing others.. She is  a  govt employee.. She cannot decide where she wants to be posted... Ppl already work hard enough to secure a govt job, after the Hectic job hours you want them to learn a alien language.. That sounds like andi mandi sandi rangi😂😂😂😂.. Most of the word sounds like galis in North india...  Forcing someone to speak and learn your language is cruelty... We don't even listen to South Indian songs... Seriously.. A person cannot learn dozens language to please ppl like you
Yaa
Because we had our own mother language....try to respect and learn other languages 😊 don't ask others to learn hindi😮
What about Maharashtra then ??? 😒
"Only southern parts of Karnataka. Hindi is fairly common in the central parts. The  northern parts of Karnataka, almost everyone speaks hindi in the urban areas and even the ones who can't don't make a fuss about it. 
But having said that, the concern of Kannadigas is genuine. The children born after 2005 can't read Kannada or speak Kannada properly even though that's their mother tongue. Then there's the nepotism and lobbying that immigrants and non natives practice. All this is manifesting into these language debates."
If you need a solution for this better you can communicate with them in english right why are you triggering all the south indians by saying speak in hindi and hindi is our national language if karnataka is present in india means why the hell they need to speak in hindi first if a person doesnt know kannada better they can communicate in english see the girl can clearly able to speak english it seems its an arogant behaviour how a non hindi speaker will speak hindi think a little bit north indians i beg for you dont create problems when come to south india if you communicate the people with english its a better choice i recommend if people know hindi then they will communicate if doesnt know hindi please dont force them to speak in hindi please 🙏 and we south indians are trying to avoid the language issue and again and again the problem starts by north indian why you are doing that we are also humans if dont know to speak hindi we will tell to you that we dont know hindi then try to communicate us in english we know it we will really help you but dont expect others to respond on hindi language alone my north indian brothers and sisters please its my kind request for you even as a south indian i supported the north indian when the auto driver who slapped the north indian girl i feel sorry that i think this comment will change😢
No, wrong.  TN says they don't want to learn Hindi.  Karnataka is open to learn Hindi.  The issue is with Hindi speakers not learning local language.  It is Hindi speakers who are creating issues in Karnataka and Maharashtra
Yes north indians please don't come to these states if you can't learn the language
​​ @Venky2853Venky    Auto driver didn't slap that girl.  He just pushed aside her mobile phone.  The whole problem is with Hindi speakers being arrogant and not learning local language
That’s why Tamilnadu and Karnataka culture somewhat didn’t become a cocktail of many cultures yet (including influence of Islamic and western culture) unlike many other Indian states and we would like it to be that way. Here are some examples which may clarify why we do what we do. You know why there are reserve forests, to save and protect animals in its natural habitat. You know why there are laws to protect UNESCO heritage sites like historical monuments and ancient places, to protect them in its original form and keep them intact. Now tell me brother what’s wrong to protect our original culture, language and our identity. I sincerely request you guys to do the same wrt your language and culture before it slowly gets extinct. Just to clarify we don’t hate other state people or language but at the same time we don’t like people who disrespect our language, feelings and our culture. In this particular case she could have just said that I’m trying to learn Kannada which is very much required for her to have basic conversation with illiterates instead of being stubborn and started arguing like a kid and said NEVER learn Kannada which I feel disrespectful to her job and local community.
"Did you try speaking Kannada in Bihar 😂😂. 
Benguluru people go out of their way to speak Hindi, Tamil, telugu, Marathi etc ,"
​ @pskpauvnambal we also have.
​ @Venky2853Venky those illiterate don't know english bro....only they know is Hindi and pan masala 😂😂😂
This is not trouble. An officer from tamilnadu will come to delhi and converse in tamil with customers. Would that work? Use some common sense
for the first time im feeling proud that we refused to learn hindi. From TN u north mfs should not have this much grudge in servicing a local customer fo that state for not able to speak in hindi. we dont have to learn or speak hindi, if we have a neccesity we will.
​ @jvzj25  They lack braincells to understand that logic.
" @Venky2853Venky  just read only 1-2 line. just to clear your misunderstanding, I never asked to learn Hindi in my comment. 

In the video its bit arrogant for her to blatantly refuse, instead of politely declining, I AGREE, specially when she is serving customers, but there may have been a provocation."
" @stick2roots  Bengaluru people are from different parts of India, so its common for them speak in multiple languages.
Not sure whats your confusion."
" @jvzj25  They can try, but one thing I am sure. The customer in Delhi would not make a scene over a petty language.
They are absolutely fine to speak English."
" @saransparkee322  Funny thing is, when you go abroad, you dont mind speaking English or whatever language people speak in that country.
Problem is only with ""Hindi"".🤣"
 @pskpauvnambal  Most of the states have their own language. Still that does not stop them learning or speaking other language.  Thats the difference.
" @Venky2853Venky  it seems u did not watch the full video (not this one, its just a edited clip). see it first, there the customer was informed that the official does not know Kannada, but the he keeps pushing her to speak on that. So the lady got defensive after his provocation & changed her tone from ""I dont know Kannada"" to ""I wont speak Kannada"".
Dont talk nonsense without knowing the full story."
" @film-masti-777  But the elser person should know to speak in english right?

English is a professional language. People who stay in home as homemakers will not know english."
clearly the kannadiga is harassing the lady here.. he is the one forcing kannada on her... she is already speaking un english
You forgot about patriotism. Is it left for rascals aka sanghis ?
If some one asks kannadiga to speak Tamil, Malayalam and Hindi in other states how can he speak.. he will manage with English or a broken lay😂😂
Kannada power ❤❤
Nobody can ask bank officers to learn local language, they are posted all over India, so do they have to learn 30 languages for 30 different states? Use common sense and don't harass bank employees just because they are providing service
This hypocrisy of speaking only in Hindi while serving the regional local customers of the bank!!!! It’s the fault of SBI for placing manager who doesn’t know how to handle the situation and engulfing the customer of bank… all Bank should take a note of this incident as into their Don’t s list
"North indians r really hooligans.... 
... see their dominance and rudeness... 
... Just watch how they bully non hindi speakers in their own states...."
Why fight for language? Speak in english. For both of you it is foreign language.
@cnnnews18 “Harssed” it seems 😂Who’s harassing whom?? It’s my place and I have all the rights to get services in my language. Don’t come and impose your language here. Btw, the SBI manager has already been punished by transferring. #StopHindiImposition
What a nonsense title? The fact is a local person was harrassed by a STUPID SBI Manager. if the bank is operating in Karnataka first preference should be given the local language. This is one of the RBI requirements to operate a bank in any state. This arrogant person should be transferred to Jaisalmer in Rajasthan. So that the person can happily converse in Hindi
Please post managers who know regional language. Respect the people who own account there
There is way of talking to customer..our money is with bank..we are not doing any charity here..if you dnt knw language tell politely i m learning or i dnt knw..i wil learn soon..but arguing like this not justified
Usko agar English ya Hindi nahi pata tha, toh he could have requested and somebody else can translate. Jo kaam ke liye aaye ho woh karo. Sirf ego satisfy karne ke liye ye sab nonsense hai. Ye Karnataka ka owner hai kya. Karnataka iske paida hone se pehle India ka hai aur India ka rahega. Aur as an Indian main kahi pe bhi reh sakta hun. Iska bacha agar gunga paida hoga toh ye usko Karnataka se bahr fek dega kyunki woh Kannada nahi bol paa raha. Karnakataka mera bhi hai. I love Karnataka. Sirf bolne na bolne se kya hoga. Aise logo ki wajah se Karnataka is the on the way of West Bengal. Just wait a few years. Fir ye bolenge saaarrrrr utta illa
I want to know which language do GOD speak..😂😂😂...same GODS are in every state so if i go and pray in my mother tongue in another state will GOD listen to me or not??😂😂
Please change the headlines. No one is harassing. Teh guy is politely asking. The lady is rude
The RBI mandates that banks use trilingual communication - English, Hindi, and the regional language of the area, for all printed materials used by retail customers. This includes account opening forms, pay-in slips, passbooks, and even display boards. The use of Hindi and regional languages in business communication and customer interactions is also encouraged.
"It is simple common sense question . Instead of understanding it people are commenting against local language .

Does this bank meant to serve people who speak only english or Hindi ? .if so then they should advertise that .

If they here to do business for local people then they should have common sense to speak in local language .

How will a local person who doesn't know english or Hindi understand whats happening with their money ? 


If business is meant for customer then they should know how to treat customer . People demanding to learn Hindi should have common sense to learn language if state where they work ."
Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada
These bullshits are all comes from political parties..
The only prople you can blame for this intolerance is Don Quixote and his minister Shahncho Panza who want to impose Hindi all over India.
South States are being foolish, we are giving job and we need to learn their languages also. But they are clever, who don't learn any 2nd or 3rd language, and get all high position jobs with Hindi. Unfair!
It's better to talk the language which both of them are good with.
Their pain point. Why should we the locals who are customers care. If they have issues let them take it up with their employer.
No need of ur bank in our state ...get lost
Go and read the RBI rule for Banks, if don't even try to learn get out from there don't state your own rules
You come to north we will teach you hindi ...dont you dare to come
This is India dear, how can you say only people knowing local language can or should work!! You can have offshore it business near chandapura. What will happen if Americans say the same 😂😂
 @veereshkuntal9188 Why not? They will come and sit in a rural customer service position and talk to you only in Tamil or English. Tit for tat.
 @soumya_gopinath Customer service is in local language in a national bank like SBI. Customer is not going to learn your language. You learn hers.
​ @Dillikidastaan how many are educated in Karnataka 🤭🤭. Just a few rest are living because of real estate🤣🤣🤣🤣
 @soumya_gopinath Really? You want to compare education and literacy figures? By that logic all the more reason to have customer service in local language.
Do you know how IBPS recruitment works? Ask anyone who got placed in their home state immediately after placement. Everyone has to serve in a different state, what will you do if Punjabis start asking kannada bank managers to speak fluent Punjabi because that's Punjab. Punjab first right?
 @sidhaunt Yes, Punjab first in Punjab. No one asks a newbie to speak fluently. But an old codger sitting there are refusing to learn local language is a trouble maker and needs to be sent to his home state. Go and serve in a village in your state and you can speak whatever language that you speak.
​ @Dillikidastaan How do you know she is an old employee? Was it mentioned in the video? I am asking because i didn't watch it, And fyi I work for NCERT in one of the remotest parts of India i.e Arunachal myanmar border, even people here have no problem speaking Hindi or English, and neither do the people force me to speak their dialect. Infact the language here is so diverse that that it changes aftery every district. So you have no idea what you're ranting about.
" @sidhaunt Listen dodo. Arunachal Pradesh is one of the most exploited states. And it is because of it’s eagerness to accept Hindi and outside influence. You have to be a Hindi speaker because you learn nothing about the local people. And use your specific example to apply on everyone. 

And SBI had shunted her out and she also apologised in Kannada on video."
"​​Yeah she had to because the guy won the narrative , and SBI won't take the headache of protests. It's far easier to transfer her. Now he can go about and brag on how he saved Kannada. But that doesn't make it right, it's not that complicated, the guy could have avoided her and instead asked for someone who speaks Kannada, and likewise the girl crossed her limits when she said she will never speak kannada etc etc.
I know what language struggle is and you don't have to teach me. Kannada is a flourishing language and there is no reason for you guys to be insecure like a high school teenager, Learning an additional language is a skill acquired whether it's Hindi or Kannada. But to be so insecure about it to the point of abusing Hindi speakers is sadly pathetic and is borderline criminal.
, @Dillikidastaan "
Brother, I think you should read the government norms before making any accusations. If you are government servant you can be placed anywhere within country and you cannot demand you want only locals to be the head of the department. It is upto government to decide who is to be placed where. Be possessive towards the country not towards the language. Country comes first, language is only a means to communicate and should not be made compulsory. I hope you will take this feedback on a positive note provided you are well educated. Thanks.
Whats the point if she speaks in kannadaa for your sake. Requirement here is customer service. It can be done without kannada too. 😂 The bank manager did not act well and fell for the language debate. She must have focussed on the requirement of the customer or boycotted him. Its a bit of arrogance to say i will never speak in kannada 😂.
 @joylife428 100% agree 👍🏻
​​ @NadimShaikh-j5b yeah. The problem is bank manager did not handle the issue well . She could have boycotted him or focused on his customer grievances 😂
"Guys,
I think some of you are missing the point and getting hooked to Hindi row! When we are in business, we should know the customer requirement- I am sure she might have opted to resolve the issue by calling any bank staff who can translate for her I.e. between customer and manager rather she brought unnecessary language row… don’t expect customer to know your language ( even foreigners who are in selling place doesn’t do that)
Education should give wisdom to handle things not to escalate further guys..good to know others perception too @ comments"
​ @vishnuvardhan-lk2yf i think my whole point here is the customer wanted to create a language war with the manager videoed it and made it viral. Unfortunate thing is young bank manager with immaturity fell for this shit. Ultimate beneficiary is the politicians of Karnataka 😂
" @NadimShaikh-j5b  Yes absolutely, does that mean you can take on customer for ride over language! My simple question is why is she trying to escalate the situation rather than trying to resolve? Is it not what she is meant for? Issue should have been handled in a very decent way by calling staff who can translate between both them…! That’s what managerial skills for dude? 
Country, language etc…. I am not into it! 
It’s a business - I am worried about bank to customer relationship…. It’s absolutely upto them to speak language of their choice ( Kannada or Hindi) 
But handling situation is definitely in the realm of bank dude!"
" @soumya_gopinath  exactly dear… for us Americans are customers and we are speaking their language to cater to their needs!  Here, point to be remembered is customer vs business!
Language war 😢"
Once slave is always slave 😂😂😂​ @vishnuvardhan-lk2yf 
How did you assume that everyone knows english? Please think!
That guy is speaking English in between and telling manager to speak in Kannada. What is happening? Super is Kannada word…just realised.
Why should we learn any other language when we have our own language to speak ... If we work in some North states we will.definitely speak in Hindi Then why you people won't even try to learn our language when you were working in our state
so apparently, according to the comment section. the sbi manager who is being rude and imposing hindi in karnataka is the one being harrased lol. you northie street shitters are such class acts lol. india is the union of states. not "hindistan". i'm indian, not "hindian". lol no wonder kashmir wants freedom from these guys. no wonder punjab wants freedom from these guys
In Tamil Nadu also, they put someone who doesn't know my language. They insist me to speak in Hindi. Did any Hindi state allow other language managers to speak in their own language to customer?
The customer is always right
Am also in Karnataka, this is too much just do your work and get away why to bother people like this,
SBI manager should speak kannada.
Language should unite people not divide. People should love your language not hate..
Hindi is written on Notes also then don't use them.
What the banker couldn't speak the man's language? And if she did! she should've just finished his work and sending him away.
Can a Kannadiga sbi officer in Delhi refuse to speak Hindi ???
What a shame CNN harassed 😂😂 she know kannada she refused to speak and CNN go and read RBI rules about local language
"Where is karnataka 
Is it not in India 
What language is thought in school all over india (Hindi)
Then comes regional language 
These kind of people must be tought a lesson 
Is he not a hindustani where hindi is our national language 
And sbi our national bank
People (staff) can be transferred from any part of India 
They are other staff in there who speaks in your language kannada"
CNN change the title.. who harrassed SBI manager.. stupid lady arrogantly replying that she doesn't speak kannada, without passing official language of that state, no would be posted in that area..are you expecting locals would know hindhi or english... Sbi service is only for hindhi speaking people..?
If customer understand only Kannada then How bankers can give them answer in Hindi or english, will he understand?
Nation comes first.... hindi speakers must stop imposing their language over others, this is against national unity. These employees will shamelessly take high salaries but are not giving basic services in the primary language of the region. This is total shame.
If you don't know the language then how you come to that state to work. And this attitude should not be tolerated.
This is ridiculous
South Indians are proper nonsense, just the media shows them as good down to earth people.
As a banker myself my opinion is whenever you get posted to any branch try to learn that states language. It makes things really easy for both the customer and bank staff. What’s wrong in learning that states language? Now imagine it other way… You are a customer who knows only Hindi and you go to a bank where the employees speak only Kannada. Wouldn’t you like it if the staff there knows Hindi to converse with you?
News 18, how could it be harassment asking public services in my language
"Of late, social media with media recordings bring out the confrontation between Kannadigas and others.
In Metro cities, such unpleasant events do occur.
However, others(in parochial sense) should be generous in such public contacts.
In this bank incident, the bank manager is a qualified appointee.Her training might have been, among others, is to deal with customers even if violent.
Cosy ambience and thick wallet in young age lead to arrogance.
Avoidable."
That why where the person get the service need to learn at minimum knowledge of reginal language
Stupid
You guys work abroad in Malaysia, Singapore, US, Europe so do you insist on speaking Tamil there also ?
🎉​​ @Newtoonnnn  There you have to learn the local language. You people get adjusted to the country language. If you go to Germeny you prapare by learning Germen language and go?
​ @Newtoonnnn making yourself a fool out of here. 2 of the country you mentioned officially says tamil also one of their language of governance. Yet you cling on with your hindhi. Until you don't understand that you eill always be more foreigner to us than the english speaking people. Learn english and if possible some words of native region
Banks ko aise transfers hi nhi krne chahiye jo north ke south ki aur aur vice versa
"Let me come straight forward 
Your state Tamilnadu is a failed one similar to Bengal.
Poor administration (not on n
paper)
Only a outsider  would agree on this statement.
I lived in Bangalore for 4 years and visited TN twice and pussy experience as usual."
Ask virat kohli to speak kannada too.right?
What nonsense! You mean to say if any language isn't printed on the notes people speaking those languages aren't supposed to use them! What rubbish!
All the official languages are also printed in notes
no they try to speek in hindi only even come from either states
Hindi is a official language btw anyone going from south to north should learn if they want to live there .
 @S.T.R.A.N.G.E.R-1 RBI rules say all bank employees should know local language, otherwise gtfo from that state
​ @S.T.R.A.N.G.E.R-1 okay. Can someone from South working in North Indian branch speak only in English?
"​ @S.T.R.A.N.G.E.R-1 idiot how can you say hindi national la guage, why we should learn in the same way what she is telling.  
Nothing doing , when you are in other states the local language should try to learn and speak."
Yes he/she can refuse. No one will force them
 @RizinSun then ask the Chairman of the bank not the employee. Why he post employees outside their language zone
Very well said
 @prabhatkumar-wm9nk this I agree.
Tbese people of Kanar.... are becoming terrorist to their own country in name of language.Aleays shouti g trdigeri ng voilrnce ....
"​ @S.T.R.A.N.G.E.R-1 most Hindi states survive on the alms of other states. 
Try respecting your philanthropist."
​ @Rajan-zo4mp yep ik that . But we don't know how amny months she has been here and if she doesn't know the local language talk to the chairman or whoever accepts their cv or if ur kind enough there were ppl there who knew Kannada u could have asked them . Its not employees mistake and the person has that rgt but there was no need for the customer to create so much fuss .
Yes if he doesn't know he can and even if he doesn't want to be bullied he can... This language drama is only to create votebanks for "secular" parties
​ @RizinSun does those who pass such orders know all regional languages of this country?
 @S.T.R.A.N.G.E.R-1 see the tragedy in india is because of folks like you. If on a scale of 1-10 Japan scores the highest with a score of a perfect 10 India will get a negative 5 (-5). There is no sense of customer service in India. All in India need to go for a customer service course. Remember CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT .
​Kannada is official and state language of Karnataka. So one should speak kannada if they want to live in karnataka?  @S.T.R.A.N.G.E.R-1 
Exactly
"​@S.T.R.A.N.G.E.R-1 

Acha and you think the reverse  is not applicable...

And even kanada is official language..."
​ @francisbacon6920 all the regional languages not needed .. local language enough
Why these people won't ask politicians from central to speak regional language.....
He will not refuse because Kannadigas are always resilient and they will serve there very well. Quite a lot of  north Indian  have too much attitude and rude
Man Kannada is not an international language 🤭🤭 not like hindi as well.
If knows he will !! If he doesn't know he will ask someone from his cader to help the customer
​ @fullstackapps5246 local languages should be spoken by locals why do you force others who have no knowledge of it to communication? Whether it be regional or local nobody should force others to use it.
"​ @francisbacon6920  Okay boss now you tell me what the SBI Manager should have done ?? She is refusing she will not speak in Kannada nor in Hindi ! 

The Customer is in trouble now needs his doubts or queries to be solved.

You tell me what should have been done by the manager?"
​ @prabhusankar8346  Before replying you let me inform you that I do not know what happened between the manager and the customer in detail, my argument is why does the localite force the employee to speak in the local language? If she is speaking in English why does the customer objecting to it? Does he not understand English which is the universal language? Since you asked me what the manager should have done my reply is that she is using an language which is spoken in all parts of India whereas regional or local languages are limited to that region or that area. It is the customer who is trying to prove that she is committing a sin by not speaking in the language which he speaks which is unfair according to me.
​ @francisbacon6920 i am not forcing... You use your language who are interesting in ur language.
​ @fullstackapps5246 if you firce i will resist just like the manager did. Why compell others to speak the lical language or regional languages, they are not national or universal languages. Where did i force you dear gobernath to soeak my regional or lical language?
​ @francisbacon6920 watch the video again man.. she literally said only hindi.. and type properly, difficult to understand due your typos...
​ @fullstackapps5246  it is her life and her preference why do you dictate others what they should do? If she prefers hindi over kannada let her why didn't the customer speak in hindi? What is wring in it? May be she does not know kannada. The customer is telling her that according to the rbi rules the employees should speak the local languages wherever they are transferred but those who make such rules they too cannot follow it.
​ @fullstackapps5246 then why is speaking in English if wanted to speak in hindi?
Yes u can speak in English.. What the fuss
​ show the copy of RBI as well
​ @chandrandec31 yes they do.
 @francisbacon6920  her life and preferences are causing loss to the bank and inconvenience to the customers in Karnataka. It is needless for the customer to speak hindi because it is Karnataka. If she doesn't know Kannada then the correct thing for her to do is to admit it politely and not like how she has done here.
​ @fullstackapps5246 who said to you that her life and preferences are causing loss to the bank? Do you mean that any employee of a nationalised bank who does not speak kannada in karnataka is not doing his/her job properly? It is mr goonda who threatened her iwas causing inconvenience to the bank staff and other customers by creating ruckus in the name of language and supporters like you who have no other work but to insert your nose in others affairs. You said in your comment that it is heedless for your customer to speak in hindi as it is karnataka then why do you people call yourselves as indians and why don't you declare that you are no longer part of India and announce that you have become independent country just because your people cannot speak hindi or any other language other than kannada in Karnataka as you might suffer  ❤ attack. You also said in your comment that if she does not know kannada she should admit it politely but your goonda too was not polite with her, he threatened her the consequences for not speaking in kannada and who knows when they started to have dialogues with eachother and your goonda is the one who recorded her statement and presented it before the media just to gain publicity and gain sympathy from the localites
Kannada tamil telgu marathi start knowing and speaking hindi as soon as they come out ..all the pride only exists when they are inside their state, hindi is most common language in India if someone doesnt know Kannada he/she should not be forced .
​ @aman5096 if it is official usage like banking, hospital, etc., then it should be mandatory, because it is Karnataka and accept or not Kannada comes first here.. no importance for most common or whatever it is outside of this state...
​ @aman5096 ​​ also not tolerating the behavior like this sbi manager's is not forcing.. it is a way of letting people like this know about what is correct..
Hardly they would get a chance 😂
Delhi is not just about hindi but harvanvi, punjabi, pahadi, rajasthani can you speak all of these languages? No!! You need hindi to connect or English. Similarly in orissa it's odia in bengal it's bengali. How many languages can a kannad speak if he gets transferred every week?
​ @RizinSun 😂😂 then go and tell your khangress rahul to first speak in kannad
​ @PrithaBhowmick-cb1cz no one even in the worst nightmare would want Karnataka to become like those states you are referring to and most of the Kannadigas I know would prefer finding an alternative jobs rather than getting transferred to bangla or other such states.
​ @fullstackapps5246 dear goberbhakt it is not the manager who was rude but your friend who was the customer of the bank who was aggressive as he could not tolerate any other language other than Kannada. My point to you is if the manager does not know Kannada then why does anyone have to force her to speak a language which she does not know whereas your friend who knew hindi as well as english had developed allergic to it. Does that mean that if he moves to any other state can he expect the localities of that state to answer him in Kannada or does he believe that he will learn their language within few minutes after enter their state?
 @PrithaBhowmick-cb1cz  are u prith bhowmick? then spell kannada u dumbaaz not kannad. Hindi is official language of delhi so no need to learn haryanvi or punjabi etc, kannada is official language of KA and so one has to know kannada in customer centric jobs. yes kannada speaker has to learn odia or bengali when they go there . we dont expect tourists to learn kannada only those who work or study here . have some commonsense
 @PrithaBhowmick-cb1cz  are u prith bhowmick? then spell kannada u dumbaaz not kannad. Hindi is official language of delhi so no need to learn haryanvi or punjabi etc, kannada is official language of KA and so one has to know kannada in customer centric jobs. yes kannada speaker has to learn odia or bengali when they go there . we dont expect tourists to learn kannada only those who work or study here . have some commonsense
She is speaking english.So,there should be no problem.Govt should arrest these gunndas who harass only bank employee.
 @vivekbhardwaj5887 this is not one case, everywhere it’s happening in Karnataka where Hindi employees are harassing Kannada customers
​ @RizinSun you don't know anything about bank working culture and simply you are falling in congi agendas.hiring of clerical staff is on state level and they must be proficient in local language whereas the officers hiring are on all india level and they are transferred very frequently.So,it is useless to ask from her to speak kanada.
forget about everything else..is that the way to behave to a customer?? fkn suspend her..
He cannot
​ @S.T.R.A.N.G.E.R-1 it is not official language
Please don't talk logic. Let's make it a language war
 @alexanderkrishnadevaraya7719 the. When you guys come to,our state then speak our language, other wise don’t come , good to see her apologize in Kannada, what a disgrace to Northies. 😂
 @vivekbhardwaj5887 banks are supposed to serve customers. The lady is a customer facing employee and she behaved like a rowdy. Why should the local man be charged? He is our hero.
"​ @S.T.R.A.N.G.E.R-1 
😂😂😂"
Of course he can, if he doesn't know Hindi he can choose to speak in English
​ @Rajan-zo4mp and all the South states depend on Northern states for their security and survival
​ @S.T.R.A.N.G.E.R-1  first she can't be arrogant to customer. Even if customer asks something hardly she could have handled politely saying i will learn it in a couple months as I am new here. Simply the guy would have moved on. Since she says hindi only this problem has erupted more. Further the north indian saying in india everyone should speak hindi is the statement which creates major issues. They don't have any rights say that in another state where the official and linguistic language is different.
​ @S.T.R.A.N.G.E.R-1 where is it published
Sir kandiga don’t know how to speak in Hindi they always speak in English sirrrrrrr😂😂😂😂😂
Guys we have better problems to  solve in india than these language issues
​@Dpk-i3xwhat?? Abt official language. If ur asking abt that let me tell whatever is published nationally is written in Hindi and English even by rbi not in state languages
The officer will speak Hindi they will hindi
​​ @S.T.R.A.N.G.E.R-1 so individual state people's language are not inclusive in a ndia
​@Dpk-i3x when did i say no . I said we have better probs to solve rather than the language things its a mode of communication more than that,  we have probs that wont even keep usalive to make that communication. So plss stop this language war and try to grow like other countries and even if govt. Doesn't do let's do our part.
​ @S.T.R.A.N.G.E.R-1 we have nit considered this as war, it's a conflict, can everyone leave the state to operate in their official language
​@Dpk-i3x then, what  would u do for north indians? or even south indians working in other states how will they learn that state languages so fast. And also u should also consider international workers so yeah it isnt possible. But the thing is either english or hindi will be a common language everywhere rather than just one state language
"​ @S.T.R.A.N.G.E.R-1 no one here is asking to learn the first day itself. We are expecting people who are staying in karnataka from past few years still don't want to learn or communicate in local language that they are staying in. If some one is really respecting another language he will definitely start learning 2-3 words. Otherwise it is only arrogance that he can show to other people. 
Please don't compare North and South in this matter, because South people do what they have to do when respecting other culture and language."
"​ @S.T.R.A.N.G.E.R-1  by the way, I have seen some foreign youtubers who visit India and each state for the first time. They learn 4-5 words and manage speaking to the local,. That means there is no reasons for not learning if you really want to learn. 
In this I really appreciate that foreigners who has more respect towards our language than some adamant indians of our country"
Yes there is a person from Karnataka here who speaks English/kannada should I made him famous?
"​ @alexanderkrishnadevaraya7719  
u people foolishness destroying indian fabric ....
they speak english but not hindi 
so arrogant"
Speaking English ,Hindi is common  one is common global language & other's our national language Hindi.. thus should be commons in all over India if u r not Indian go n Speak whatever shit , Urdu u want to speak
"​​​​ @ShubhiSingh-oo1vf  go and do research, who said or declared hindi as the national language to you. That's why you will always be called an unpad gawar. 
Who are you to decide that if I don't know hindi, I will not be Indian. 
And we know more than the South, North is using urdu.and you don't have guts to stop that"
Kannada is not welcome in ayodhya temple until they speak fluent awadhi 😂😂
 @NarmadeshwarMahadevTemple  abe chutiye, a Kannadiga only sculpted Shri Ram idol of Ayodhya !!! stop dividing hindus by imposing hindi on south indians.learn kannada
seems kannad have all the problems in life
 @ShubhiSingh-oo1vf  by the way we in Bangalore will continue to resist Hindi and insult it as well. Let us see what you can do?
​ @prabhatkumar-wm9nk  but the employee has no rights to behave in the manner she is behaving. She's government servant
How about the  poor rural  customers who don't know hindi
"​ @soumya_gopinath  exactly  so government should appoint localites to serve in banks within the state as outsider don't know not ready to learn also disrespect and try to impose their own language in turn.  For many it's ok for a hefty packaged staff to not to know language of the locals but locals should understand and cooperate with thei hindi 
Very sad  for customers"
 @Meenakshi-i9w7g  come with a translator or ask for a local person..don't force others to speak what you want..
​​ @Priyaraina-s3j  it's better bank has a translater bcoz they are here to give service they are paid  for giving service. You cannot force custmer to bring translatet in the same way she has come here not for a trip she's is being paid royally for her service. North indians their dressing sense is rstetn but least civic sense they behave even in Western countries similarly however  educated they are
 @Meenakshi-i9w7g  no one is paid to speak in kannada...This country has 50 languages and 100 dialects..better to learn our 1 language Hindi..else ask smone to help..don;t create a scene like this person..this is nothing but language politics..and kannads are champion in this..
​ @Priyaraina-s3j  😂    ridiculous
 @Meenakshi-i9w7g  Exactly 🤑
​ @harshbhai11  You mean security guards & their survival.... Beggar state rep😂
"​ @S.T.R.A.N.G.E.R-1 if that is the case we should swap the seats of security guards & chairman...
SBI is a useless bank dumped in Indians..."
Why not. No language in india must be forced on its citizens. Even though bank manager need not speak in kannada its essential to address the issue of its customer rather than a language war breaking out. Tells u she is immature 😂
​ @S.T.R.A.N.G.E.R-1  Hindi is official but not all india language😂😂😂
I have seen a Kannadiga office in west bengal speaking English only. Whenever he is interacting with local he is taking a translator with him. The problem can be solved keeping a translator while talking with locals
​ @arindampal4982  there is similarities between bengali and Hindi😂😂😂
​ @arindampal4982 the problem is not with the manager. Although manager could have handled this issue better. The intention of the customer is to create a language war and make it viral for his viewership. 😂
 @arindampal4982 he should learn Bengali asap.
​ @Priyaraina-s3j  instead of asking the entire local population to learn an unknown language, the better thing to do is that official person should learn the official language in that state
" @fullstackapps5246  Entire population already knows Hindi..poora BAngalore Hindi bolta hai..
It's a kannad langauge drama by few people..jo samajh nahi paate hindi ko..pure politics.."
​ @Priyaraina-s3j  It seems like obviously u r a discriminative person due to your preference of  hindi u r surrounded by hindivalas which is the reason for ur current mental condition due to which you are assuming ur circle is the entire world.. come out and experience the world. identify, accept and tolerate other people.
"​ @sudipshettynoojjis7851 
Ya u r right"
"​ @RizinSun 
Dear, 
He was posted in Bengal for 5-6 years and it is pot possible for a person to learn a language in that short span of time after doing full day work in bank.
But the bank manager was a very good person and helpful in nature. He was from mandya and he helped me in transferring my account from Kolkata to Bangalore.
But nobody has questioned him regarding why he is not doing communication in Bengali."
"​ @arindampal4982  If this lady was kind and helpful here also nobody will ask what language she speaks 

She is acting entitled that's the problem"
"​ @joylife428 dear there is a difference between Hindi and south indian languages 

Hindi is mostly considered as language only as it is new and north indian languages as constantly under change

But in south languages associated with cultural 

These languages are old and have rich history 

Sea how Hindus died for religion in past in same way most of kannadigas marathis, tamilans died to save their language 

When a person is ready to sacrifice him for language u should understand how much it's mean to him


If tell u most people are Cristian and muslim so u convert to that religion will u agree 

Or let's say china is leading country in world let's settle in China and forget India will u agree

No because it's ur identity

In same way south people give too much importance to language 

U say Bharath mata

And we also karnataka mata she is the daughter of Bharath mata

We see her as godess 

It's not only political matter it's the matter of emotions identity 

U r so intelligent so u may know why Bangladesh got separated from Pakistan 

We don't want it to happen here

Hope u people understand"
​ @sbams3245 my whole point is in india nobody should force anyone to speak in a particular language. Everybody has the right to speak in their mother tongue . At the same time language barriers should not be politicised which is the case in tamilnadu and karnataka. The government should take steps to protect their languages in educational institutions and government bodies only. Not on private sectors
​ @sbams3245 i speak tamil. My language is older than kannada malayalam telugu or sanskrit. We have evidence on that. As soon as tamil language got special recognition all languages also appealed for special recognition like kannada and malayalam for political reasons. Still i do not like language politics in 21st century. A language will only grow if there are scientific inventions on that and has better social values on the society. No point in writing speaking and spreading can help a language to grow 😂
"​ @joylife428   don't get fooled by these videos 

These fights usually personal when they can't defend themselves they turn it into language fight 

Just like all personal fight which includes people from different religion is named as hindu muslim fight

All personal fight which include different cast people are considered as cast discrimination 

In same way last week a road rage was turned as language fight for views

So neglect these"
"​ @joylife428 agreed but its not necessary everybody will think that way

Some may think in different way too

Everyone are not scientist right

Logic can't be applied for larger population but emotions will work"
​​ @sbams3245 what do u want to achieve with emotions. What do u want to achieve with a language . Tamil language had so much to offer us few decades back . Now english has taken over in tech companies. How do u want to reshape tamil or kannada for that matter to compete with english . Take china and japan . Most of their high tech equipments are in their local language. Why not in india . Thats the only way forward
​ @sbams3245 language is only a tool or method of communication only. Even a dumb and deaf can survive without speaking a language.😂😂
​​ @RizinSun  bank employees does not get their job by directly coming to the bank...no one can do any job directly where they want...one should pass some exams and interview to get the job and who gives the job to them knows very well where to speak in which language...
Correct
" @Priyaraina-s3j Hindi is the language of achuths chutiyas and pariahs. We in Karnataka do not belong to this group. We the locals won’t speak the neech ghaitya brasth Gandhi nali ki Basha Hindi which doesn’t have a neutral gender. 

Hindi is the language of the backward Bikhari BIMARU states and we in Karnataka don’t speak it."
 @joylife428 you have not been to either China or Japan so shut up. Language did not make them good in technology. In Japan it’s the feudalistic culture and in China it’s because of communism.
" @Priyaraina-s3j nobody 
Speaks the neech ghatiya brasth gandhi nali ki basha Hindi. It’s spoken only by the achuths and chutiyas who have come to our state because their states are backward bikhari and BIMARU. Less than 8% speak
Hindi in Bangalore."
​ @Priyaraina-s3j you are talking like the same bank manager in this video who has now been transferred out of Karnataka for her behavior.. what else I can say
You replied in English ... How is it possible ? Did your Mom visit south  for the survival of your family ?
 @fullstackapps5246  She got a better place in North.I believe she is happy..no racism no kannad gundagardi..
​ @Priyaraina-s3j kicking out for such behavior is not racism. But her behavior is racism
 @fullstackapps5246  we see that daily at Bangalore now..pure politics..
​ @Priyaraina-s3j if hindivalas stop this drama, then there will be no political gain from this issue
 @fullstackapps5246  dRama was started by kannada lady in a bank..and then by your nonsense CM..busy in kannad and muslim politics..corrupt to the core..
​ @Priyaraina-s3j again asking for the service in the official language of the state is not drama, what this manager is doing is the drama... It looks like drama to hindivalas because they have a mental condition which is making them believe they can use hindi wherever they go...
This man is just forcing to speak kannada....if he really doesn't understand Hindi...then ok...but he is just forcing.... narrow thinking...
​ @AviralAlankrit no he is educating that so called sbi manager woman, who is using unknown language in the state.
​ @fullstackapps5246 wat do you mean unknown language?..
​ @fullstackapps5246 ...not just state...you guys should think about country too
Can kannadiga sbi officer speak fluent Assamese ?
It is not about refusing gentlemen it is about forcing someone...
​Sad thing is some people think about even the basic expectation as forcing and find reasons for silly argument...
​ @soumya_gopinath  Yeah Hindi is not even the classical language of our country. Cannot be compared with the Kannada which has rich history and literature.
​ @aman5096 Hindi is is the most common  language in Hindia not in the whole of India. It is the oldest of foreign languages that is spoken in India.its mother is Persian and father is Arabic.
​ @chandrandec31 Hindi is the beatifuullest langues in the whole berld.Even  Modiji's close frend Donald Trumph and his gharwali has started lerning Hindi.😊
india is the union of states. who tf are you to teach us a lesson?? when tf did india became hindistan?? if hindi is the national langauge then your mom is my wife. INDIA was created under the pretext that all langauges, cultures, religion,etc will be treated equally. if that's not the case then india has no right to exist as one country.
You can learn all languages?
​ @sachinyadav-im1rj Bimaru states are illiterate but you proved. Not everyone knows english
Manager should have been first told that​@sachinyadav-im1rj
Bhai jo clerk hota hai vo usi state ka hota hai vo translate kr dega.officer bank mei all India kahi bhi transfer ho sakta hai
​ @myfirstjourney7802  bhai uski sun kaha rha tha wo insan.use bs video bnana tha else jo clerk h wo side se bol to rhe h
everyone knows Hindi..This person created the drama and recorded it just to create an issue..we can see that clearly..Motive is to harrass people..
 @Priyaraina-s3j who says everyone knows Hindi. Why should locals learn Hindi? You have never been to Karnataka then.
 @EshAnian-q5o  I goto BAngalore every month..even chai wala..cab wala and office wala..all speaks in Hindi.. 🤩🤩🤩
Abe namune bandar ke puchh .central gov employee is to mandatory.transfer every..3-4 year respectively....how possible to learn  and speak. Every language....nanadr ke puchh ko loan or kuchh or issue tha so that he issued language problem.... nonsense........
 @manmitprasad924  ye log Hindi hate karte hain..aata in sabko hai..par politics karenge..ye India ki racist community hai..
 @Priyaraina-s3j I am born raised and live in Bangalore. So don’t bluff. You are a third rate liar but that’s the trait of you bloody Hindi wallahs. Hindi is a neech ghatiya brasth Gandhi nali ki basha that has no neutral gender. Why should we speak such a deprecated primitive language?? The Hindi that you think is spoken is Deccani Urdu.
Aap kannada(any local language) sikhne ka try bhi nahi karna chahate, hume bhi hindi sikhna zaroori nahi lagta, because we are living in our own state & have learnt our own local language. So, if you want to mingle with local people then you need learn local language, kyun ki zaroorat aapko hai hume nahi. Agar hum dusre state jaayenge toh hum bhi us state ka language sikhenge.
​ @manmitprasad924  are bhai 3-4 year main language nahi seek paye ga kya 😂😂.... Employee duty to coperate with customer okay....
But this man is just forcing to speak kannada...he is not even a customer...just came here to fullfill his agenda
​ @EshAnian-q5o ...if you say...why people learn hindi then why someone learn kannada....hindi speaks broadly in india....if you learn English..why not hindi ..BKL
 @Priyaraina-s3j  this is ur arrogance speaks, please post ur any social media id here and say i speak only hindi...
 @manmitprasad924  are namune bandar what u r saying its right, she could say that, i dont know kannada, pls speak with who knows kannada here, how she can say in arroganently i never speak kannada, what kannada is pakistan laungauge,
 @QueensClick143  it's my decision how to write..who are you to force others?
 @Priyaraina-s3j  the same way kannadigas are king in karanataka, who are u to ask to speak in hindi. kannadigas are king in karnakataka, tamilians are kings in tamilnadu, marathis are kings in maharastra, gujarathis are king in gujarat. out siders are just outsiders, u come to my home and asking me to speak in ur laungauge ? u speak in our laungauge or get out to where ur laungauge speaking states... 0% tolerance on laungauge insults...
" @QueensClick143 same way  who are you to force us to speak in kannda when we don't want to speak in kannda? And who are you to force others? This is straignt goondagardi..
That's why Bangalore is a kannad slum while Delhi is Cosmo.."
 @QueensClick143  isiko bolte hain kannad goondagardi...Hindi aati hai..par inka hate jyada bada hai..
 @Priyaraina-s3j  CM is doing kannad goondagardi..what to expect from these people..
 @AviralAlankrit  He is creating an issue..this is kannad politics and nothing else...iska kaam ha nosnense karna..wahi kiya..
But this man is not customer.... customers are always common people who visit the bank branch....they don't have time for this time stuff...bank is not a place where we need to make long conversation...
 @Priyaraina-s3j  you come to my house and u forcing me to speak in ur laungauge, is that acceptable, if u come to karnataka atleast learn few words to speak, dont show arrogant behavior. its my house my rules and my laungauge are applying here, not guest rules.... if u dont like it, please dont come here, its very simple madam...
 @QueensClick143  don't come to our office and force us to speak in kannada..goto your village and speak there..this is a Hindustan not your local kannadistan slum..ok madam..mind it now..
 @mercikr8274  true..cheap politicians craving for cheap votes..such people are a threat to our country
Why the manager forced to speak kannada She is from Hindi state & speaking in national language She is right
​ @ashras2510  who said hindi is national laungauge 😂😂😂
 @ashras2510  pure cheap kannad politics..nothing else..inspired by corrupt khangress..
What stupid people, ifbthis person go to other state for job will he be able to speakbthat another language other than kannada. Have some common sense.
Very good job 👍
You people are imposing Hindi on us we don't want you people to work in Karnataka get lost you media people don't care about locals feeling the pain when they aren't known hindi and you people are supporting Hindi imposing shame on you CNN
It's in RBI policy, banking services should be given in regional languages
Meanwhile Bangalore : flooded 😂😂
We Support SBI manager and She said correct India first.
I think for people who can't speak or understand either Hindi or English the Bank should provide someone who speaks the local language. I am not saying that the person taking the video is right but I am sure there are a lot of localites who can only speak their mother tongue. Why should there be unnecessary fight over this. lol
E sulemunde r ge kelsa kodbardhu
"Why okay with a foreign language when we have Hindi to bridge gap? Hindi is an Indian language, It's derived from Sanskrit. Hindi is not the national language or official language but widely spoken language. Why people force us to speak in their native language? Kannada should be spoken by Kannadigas only, Marathi should be spoken by Marathis only, Tamil with Tamilians so Why force that language on us who doesn't even know abc of that language? 
If you dont know Hindi, it's absolutely okay but dont disrespect our language and expect us to learn your language. If you really want us to learn your language, leave it on us. Maybe we'll learn that with our own wish, not by force."
Arey entra idi
SBI office in on EGO 😮
Super bro .. take back your state before its too late 🙏
Oppss!...this would not happen if the manager had known the local language. I often see in Assam if any recruitment is there they will mention Assamese is mandatory it's for the people who might not know English or Hindi...only local language...
A person who is new to any place , how will he or she will be able to speak the local language
"No. 1 mentals in India are kannadigas...
Its a government job...
They may get transferred/ promoted and can send to another states.
Its not in their hands....
You can ask the government....but how could an individual is responsible for this....
Tharkuris......"
Bank jobs are transferable.. May be the manager is not comfortable with Kannada. At the same time if customer is more comfortable with the local language, instead of escalating the issue some one from the bank could have helped to bridge the language barrier..
Customer is an idiot! He understands the subject very well in English, however,he is hell bent on harassing the Lady Branch Manager! Let this third class customer go talk in Marathi in Maharashtra or in Bengali in West Bengal!
Leftists, Marxista, chinese and pakis are finding newer ways to divide india.
Language terrorists
The govt should get strong laws to persecute those creating ruckus and chaos in public places for such a silly thing. If we all other states boycott kannada products will be a great lesson
Only for RRBs not IBPSs
​ @alvinmondal2468  Who governs banking services? if a branch is in some locality, to whom it does serve? Locals? If not then what's purpose of keeping that branch? Just pack up
You come to north we will teach you hindi
​ @veereshkuntal9188  then why come to south?  We ll have learn Hindi if we need to go to North and we need to learn Hindi to speak with Northies who comes to South..
​ @veereshkuntal9188  because of this attitude only Bhimaru sucks. 😂.  coming here to earn your livelihood and showing attitude. Beggers
No there is no rule. Think what happens to kannadigas working in other states before you do this as well.
 @abhinavreddi7851  So if a person from karnataka goes to delhi and speak in kannada will that work?
Anybody working in a particular state will automatically learn their lanGuage. First of all banking or any public service should know local language. There are natives who don't get education and only speak local lanGuage won't get any service if people say i won't speak local language and arrogantly say you should know hindi or other language . I won't speak kannada is hilarious because she is inefficient and incapable to learn other language.
 @jvzj25 Yes it works. There are a lot of people in Delhi. Delhi is a wrong comparison my brother. What I meant to say is there is no such rule for blue collar employees by RBI or any public sector. Let’s just agree on English. Let’s ask them with love and compassion to learn kannada. I am a Telugu guy but I love Kannada and learned it from a Kannadiga roommate in usa even though I never had necessity. Only thing I want to stress on is let us treat them as guests.
"If an IAS or IPS officer has been posted to a state they will first give training to learn the local language mainly speaking and conversation training !! 

Please don't talk nonsense in the comments like if a Kannadiga goes to Delhi or if a Tamilian goes to Delhi etc."
These guys will immediately remember hindi once they are in Delhi , mumbai , kolkata etc. but as soon as they reach their state they only know Kannada marathi telgu .such behaviour is a big hindrance to national integration imagine a soldier from Delhi saying he will protect only hindi speaking portion of country ..any one creating such divide on basis of language must be punished by law .
 @prabhusankar8346 I want to stress something there is a rule that white collar workers must learn the language but there is no rule for blue collar workers who come on a temporary posting. Central postings are permanent postings in state cadre. So please understand and ask them with love. We are one country after all.
Karnataka has been a universal city for decades and let’s ask them to learn Kannada with love and respect. Treat them like guests . I love Kannada and I am a Telugu maga who know Kannada. I learnt without force even though I never worked in Bangalore. Please exercise restraint.
 @abhinavreddi7851  Thank you for the comment. I am just stating what i have seen in branches. I see elder people who know kannada all their life are being asked to speak in english/hindi to do bank transactions. Please understand the issue. For metro cities i agree customers handle it. for sub cities it is a hige problem.
"​ @aman5096  Your argument makes absolutely no sense at all. India is ""unity in diversity"" please take this in your heard deeply!! 

You people want your stuff to be easy so everyone in India are been forced to learn Hindi ! 

You mean to say if everyone in India knows or speaks Hindi then everyone will be united ?? Is it ?? If not its big issue?"
"​ @abhinavreddi7851  In that case the Manager should have said I know only Hindi and English so I will ask some from my cader to help with your queries.

Such a big mess and scene was unnecessary from the manager!!"
"​ @abhinavreddi7851  To be honest my Mother tounge is Tamil but i respect Kannada as much as Tamil and Know to speak very well.

No one is forcing, as a customer he asked please say in Kannada I don't understand. What to expect from him."
 @jvzj25 I understand the pain. I am also South Indian. But destroying the Karnataka’s universal fabric is no good. There are issues, there should be kannadiga employees to help the local people. That we way more employees can be created
 @prabhusankar8346 I understand. Same happens in Telangana too. But we let them go as we know Hindi. I strongly object to Hindi as a national language. But let’s give them some time. They will understand I hope
 @prabhusankar8346 Mine is Telugu bro. I know Kannada and Tamil as well. I know Hindi too. We are civilized people bro. They are just starting to understand that Hindi is not the only language in this country
​ @abhinavreddi7851  Definitely there are instances where i speak Hindi too because I know to read and write Hindi as well. At the same time to locals i simply suggest them to learn local language as soon as possible, even one or 2 words or sentance will do and also be humble with the locals, don't say i know only Hindi i will only speak Hindi etc !!. I keep say them.
 @prabhusankar8346 agreed bro
"​ @abhinavreddi7851  I get the point but some are very very rude you know, they simply taunt locals this simply triggers them. So i always say them if you don't know say I don't know, if don't understand say I don't understand, say I will learn, say teach me i am ready to learn use such phrases i say them.

Respect or being humble is not a one way traffic its a 2 way traffic. They should also reciprocate."
Then why they transfer us in other language area without giving language training? No employee ever want to go kannada Or Maharashtra but top management forcefully transfer to such areas
​​ @Mohittiwariji  This is not the answer, it's management issue nothing to do with the public. Every customer service should have the option of regional language. That's it. No arguments, no bullshits. Anything but at the cost of loosing mother tongue in motherland even nationalism.
​ @abhinavreddi7851  Does Kannadigas or any other non-hindi people force you speak in Kannada in North India. Same applies to everyone. She is a public servant whoes bank branch is in Karnataka
​​​ @veereshkuntal9188 you North Indian learned hindi and lost many regional languages you don't even realise that and if you speak Hindi in non hindi speaking state what will uneducated and poor people do bank is for common people just have sense if kannada manager in Delhi refused to speak in hindhi will you accept it all Indians are my brothers and sisters
​​ @aman5096 Oh hello, your statement is anti national statement, Which devides the nation. When we speak in hindi in hindi state, you provide service in Kannada when you are in KA. How could it be anti-national asking a customer service in regional language. If you guts, if you are born to single father then try to implement such law and see. Idiot first know the difference between nationalism and diversity. India is diverse in nature.
​ @aman5096 Don't apply your bullshit logic. Defence is not a customer service. The demand is customer service in regional language. Some people who never went outside karnataka only knows Kannada, then why should they learn hindi. This is what's imposition. Your imposing your language on my people. Beggers why do you come here, stay in your place only
 @abhinavreddi7851  Yes get them involved to help rather than saying i will not speak and you can do whatever you want!
what if someone does not speak regional language? can't he get banking services?
​ @film-masti-777  I am not saying that regional language should be only available. KA has adopted trilingual policy. Don't come up with your filthy mindset arguments just to impose hindi. and one More thing if you live in non hindi state you should learn local language, if your crossing your state, you should know that. Don't impose your filth on locals.
​ @film-masti-777 he can where he knows the regional language
​ @sparemovie1  learning a new language is no joke that too a level to understand and communicate with locals will take a long time and effort. And do you even know how much pressure the SBI manager handles daily ??? It's insane already... To support and assist there is clerical post for them it's necessary to know the local language is proficient in the language.
​ @prabhusankar8346 Chinese , Americans , Europeans don't have to fight over language so they are able to kick ur a@@ you are still slave mentality Mughals and British used the same mentality to slave us , your slave dna has not changed you still think somewhere that talking about language and forcing it will give u identity and self pride. Ur self pride is so small that it doesn't understand the concept of national integration you are not responsible for India as a country but u r very responsible for kannada as a language . Shameful !!
We already know hindi stupid but we don't want to speak Hindi inside Karnataka ​ @veereshkuntal9188 
​ @abhinavreddi7851 Kannadiga will respect and speak in local language don't worry
Only for regional rural banks 🏦
Lots of Kannadigas are working in odisha.we don't force them to talk in odiya.bcz we are secure about our language, culture.we are not insecure atall like you moron Kannadigas.wait i will teach you odia
How shameful he is fighting ,he is forcing someone to speak in some language ,though there is clearly seen some banking staff know kannad.he has the intention to fight only
 @jvzj25 he you idiot ,1st guy is forcing she has to tell kanada .If he has the issue ,he can access other guys as well ,where it can be seen some bank staff speaking Kannada
Where in your village... shameless person you are ok with english...why your father was from uk
​ @sparemovie1 Where in your village... shameless person you are ok with english...why your father was from uk
 @sar-itsenough60 do you even know what he said? Do you understand Kannada in the first place? So when you don’t why do you say that man was wrong?
 @monalisaswain627 English puts bread 🍞 on the table. It’s a universal language unlike Hindi which is a neech ghatiya brasth basha that is spoken by the achuths and chutiyas of this country. Why should we learn such a primitive language?
​ @monalisaswain627 in our village we speak our local language only and we expect the people working in our area also speak our langauge. people like you are only shameless when you come to our place and arrogantly say we won't speak your language. Then the same way we won't speak your language. Since your father might have Born to hindi speaker you may speak in hindi but we are not born to hindi speakers so we won't speak hindi. If english is foreign language according to you then the same way hindi is also foreign language to us. If you will speak only hindi then don't any jobs or job postings in south india. If a south indian gets a posting in North they create this kind of scenes and simply they learn that local language silently. But why you people have so much arrogant to learn other language. In arguments with south you say learning hindi benefits us but wont you get benefit from learning our language .You need our jobs but not our language then what kind of person and what kind of selfish arrogant upbringing this could be. Just useless and inefficient learners you northies are except hindi you can't learn anything that why you others to learn your language nothing else. Period.
looks like you are creating policy as per your own preference & defence.
" @film-masti-777 go read the RBI guidelines and directives. 

https://www.pib.gov.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=118690"
​ @film-masti-777  nobody need to create it for own preference. If you have read and know the rbi rule then you won't comment like this. Its a mandate of rbi to provide service in local language apart from english and hindi. Its a basic common sense. How a 45 year old of 60 year old people will learn hindi and english now. Banking staffs are highly educated and well paid. So theres nothing wrong in expecting them to speak in local language. Further customer is god. So you need to serve them in the language they know. You can't simply arrogantly say i won't speak local language. If you don't want to speak the local language in job which mandates it. Then resign and sit in your hometown and talk hindi or whatever language you like. Nobody cares.
Go and ask to RBI For recruitment of local people 😂😂
​ @makeknowledgerational7655 .Further its not rbi who will suffer the bank's who employs them will.suffer with loss of customers. Let them get all the deposits from hindiwalas instead of locals. Don't worry. Let people like you keep doing this. Then all states will put a law and shut the movement of outsiders without knowing the local language. Even some states already have that. But still some hindi speaking cheaters do fraud ,pay money and get the job literally without knowing language they write the language paper with proxy and clear it. You all should be proud of cheating in all govt exams , neet exams and everywhere possible. 😂😂😂😂 Need to applaud for the lack of interest and zero knowledge to learn a new language.
Aao kbhi north me ...sikhate hai policies tumko shudh hindi me 😂
​ @abhinavreddi7851  brother kannadigas are already learn where he goes okay... But north people are fool and does not speak and learn other language..... 😂
😂😂😂😂
​ @JohnWick-z1k9c 😂😂😂😂😂 India First Regional states next. We Support SBI manager. Boycott Karnataka and dont visit and do jobs in Karnataka.
​ @JohnWick-z1k9c  what problem you have?
RBI guidelines first
​ @hit2129 and they dnt say learn local language compulsory
​​ @hit2129 India first Country first then RBI, SBI and Karnataka.She should resign jobs why such jobs where there is no self respect and humiliation. People threaten bank managers in the name of regional languages. The educated can survive anywhere.
For SBI employees, RBI guidelines is first​ @rickym2355 
As per the RBI guidelines, bank employees should communicate in regional language. So that customers can understand mainly in rural areas
​ @rickym2355 She can politely say that she doesn't know the language and try to learn. Instead of that she starts arguing as typical "lunch ke baad aana" style . After effects - apologised and transferred
​ @hit2129 As per video Customer was provoking and instigating her not Bank manager. Her tone was polite only that fellow was only rude and created newsense. Nobody should insist to speak in my regional language only instead that is your karanataka take other employees as translator and try to sort out rather than showing regional feeling. As per video fault is customer only
Then why she apologized? and got punishment transfer. I'm from Kerala not Karnataka​ @rickym2355 
Simple dont go if u cant adapt and be polite
why cant the woman speak English... ? Why should the kannadiga speak Hindi ?
​ @kircyclone  in the whole video the lady spoke in English.. in fact the Kannadiga guy was speaking in kannada  in between
 @vardaanthapa   fine... cant you see its her manners to learn the local language to serve the local people ? I'm from tamilnadu I have seen lots of IAS from punjab learnt tamil when they were in deputation inside tamilnadu...
​ @kircyclone  she could have handled it better definitely.. but something happened before .. we don't know that... the man must have talked in an authoritative tone or might have become aggressive... moreover he knows english and is talking in  english.. so this becomes bullying.. this looks like ego clash.. if he doesn't know english then i can understand ...
" @vardaanthapa   Talking authoritative... ? SBI is popular for its such relationship with its customers... if you don't believe go to a small branch you'll know how much the poor customers are illtreated by the bank employees... 

The point here is not the aggressiveness of any one... the local kannadiga is asking for the bank employee to talk in his local language, but she is refusing... this is not happening only in karnataka but also happening in all the Central govt offices in Tamilnadu... I wish the north indians better learn manners..."
I think you lost your knowledge 🤡🤡🤡​ @kircyclone 
​ @kircyclone  Want kannada in other states it's mean you are mental health condition 🤡🤡🤡
​​ @kircyclone when she doesn't know how will she speak..the issue is with bank to transfer non kannadiga in rural karnataka.... now think if someone forces you aggressively to talk in Marathi when in Maharashtra you will also feel threatened, no matter what ... we have to be understanding... kannadigas and tamils are pretty staunch... the man in the video knows english but asking kannada from a north indian... and ahe clearly doesn't know kannada.. this is clearly threatening.. imagine yourself in the situation.. you will act similar in some other state
" @vardaanthapa   I wont feel threatened when someone forcibly asks me to talk any language... Recently I have been to bangalore, If someone asked me to talk in kannada I'd have politely tell them ""Please forgive me sir, I'm new to karnataka If I live here for some more months I'll learn kannada and talk to you in kannada""... I won't argue with them saying I'll only talk in Tamil and you kannadigas also have to learn tamil if you want to talk to me. Well If i said so, that I'll consider as myself rude. 

We are civilized people who know to respect any language and we expect other civilized people also give the dude respect to the respective languages.... we just expect the manager to be civilized."
​​ @kircyclone oh you are a great person sir/maam.. or are a teenager with no experience of life i guess... if someone forcibly asks then also you will be polite then you are too docile or lack self respect.... But I think you share the same policy like this man in video being a Tamilian.. i don't blame you... you guys can't see past language.. we don't need pakistan, we have so many things to fight on amongst ourselves.... May God give you an opportunity soon to be polite when someone forces a language on you...  that day you will see how you react.. bye bye.. reflect
 @vardaanthapa   I was a teenager 30 years ago. There is nothing wrong in being polite... And I'm a tamilian I know how to respect people and their languages... I'm not like people with Hindi Supremacy. We Tamils fighting the Hindi supremacy for the past 70 years... Still they are unable to understand to give respect to other people's language. Useless people.
​ @kircyclone sorry to say ,mentally you are a teenager.. you have not seen life enough and are closed minded... read Gita.. there is nothing in this moh maya.... This is what is fed to you from childhood and hence you are like this.. no language is superior m it is just a means to communicate...
 @vardaanthapa   If no language is superior why the bank manager refused to talk kannada. I'm happy to know that I'm a teenager mentally... as of me age is just a number. I understand your mentality when you suggest to read Gita.... Gita is a book in which Krishna brainwashes Arjuna to kill his hundred own brothers, his grandfather and his teacher. And also Gita says Krishna created 4 varnas.  I'm not a supporter of a murderer and social inequality. I lead my life based on love and respect. I'm sure I cannot expect those things from a person who reads and suggests Book like Gita.
​ @kircyclone oh now i get it... you are not a hindu only 😂... that is why so staunch.... it's okay.. your small brain can't process the essence of gita or for that matter any religion.... no language is superior that is why both should be speaking in english and no one can force anybody to talk in any language.. the lady didn't force him to talk in hindi.. but the man forced her .. that is the difference.. now if you are denying this fact, you are blinded by some belief ..take care
Don't expect this kind of common sense from indians. This is too much of a expectation.
👉 point❤
U r out of box
Exactly, when the customer and the manager both know English, this merely seems as an Ego issue. The branch manager could have easily handled the situation by politely saying that she does not know kannada and if anything needed other staff can help.
No, not correct.  It is the Manager who is the idiot.  Doesn't she know a simple thing that she needs to converse in the local language with customers?
Not all customers know English Hindi. The Manager could have the broad mind to say that i can try and will do next. Humility is crucial
​ @vijaybhatt8467  I think you are missing the point bro I dont care if other languages are used elsewhere within offices or on signboards but you have to understand local languages are important for emergency services, government offices, and public sector offices where people who know only local languages can go sometimes, so basically you are denying their right to conduct their business just because they don't know Hindi which isn't even a national language
Regional language first...
 @vijaybhatt8467  What if he is not understanding a bank term in english and wants in simpler terms in a language of his choice. If you are not able to serve the customer needs it is best to close the shop.
​ @jvzj25  If they are not providing required services, we should better close our account in such banks. SBI is pathetic if they can't train their employees.
​ @raghubharadwaj7122  I agree with you. Officials should be trained about the language.
Have basic civic manners before commenting....go ahead and boycott...if you can....nobody forced u norties to come down to south...u people cant find job in ur own states and migrate...so behave like migrants...strict rules must be created against hindi speaking people to have better understanding of local language not the other way around
This is the reason what happened in pahalgam
Applicable criminal action may be considered against the Bank Manager who is on exchequer feed for deficiency of services to an impertinent school-girl retort to a customer.
"Godi Media @CNN-New18 that SBI employee is clearly harassing the customer by saying she will speak only in a useless dialect. The news is reported wrongly. 
Looks like Tax paying states are harassed by Hindi Gang. Donno what they will do if these states say we will ban you in our soil ?"
Having common sense is becoming an extra skill India.
Compromise - both parties speak english.
let him go to Kannada bank why SBI?
This person demanding kannada. If all non Kannadigas leave Karnataka and the blood line of Karnataka, Bangalore will collapse. Kannnadigas will only run Government offices, nothing else. This is a fact.
Speak kannada in kannada. Or get out
its India not Hindia northies should understand this and respect local laugaunges
She can be polite saying I can't understand.
Bank should recruit local people from the same state
Day by day societies are producing Idiots..
"Send this man to bhojpuri speaking area in UP and then ask him to speak Bhojpuri. Then only these people will understand learning other language is not easy. Bank employee are regularly transferred all over India, we are not super human who can learn regional language on every transfer.
These are illiterate people who never went outside the state and think about the supremacy. They are disregarding our country"
Congress govt saare
Why they post people away from Their region that's the problem, people who are from same region will be able to communicate better with their people
Karnataka people acts illiterate 🤬😡😡
They can use interpreter in office. This is madness.
I think bank staff should learn local language. At least try to learn, not to impose
"Kannada people forgot there are many more important things to focus on..... IT'S INDIA DAMN IT.......
All Kannada people in Central Govt jobs should quit......and also issue passports specially for Karnataka. 
India is a diverse country we used to read in schools. Really??!

Kannada people should focus on their kannada people if they speaking mother tongue or not.....ok. Nobody is destroying your mother tongue. It's just to let people move away from real problems."
Kannadigas' language prblm ceases to exist when start talking with Muslims
നമ്മൾ മലയാളികളെ പോലെ വിശാല മനസ്‌ക്കരല്ല ബാക്കി ഇന്ത്യക്കാർ, പ്രത്യേകിച്ച് കന്നടക്കാർ
You are referring to this lady bank manager isn’t it?
 @EshAnian-q5o  Both. If that lady officer has even a brain she will try not to speak in Hindi, no one will be triggred. On the other side, He has no idea about how his state will be,  if no other state person come to live there. Bengaluru is the result of cheap labour  from north east , tech brains from south , business force from west India.
He is referring that bank lady... As she doesnt have basic sense to talk and respect inside others home
 @dnbpedvk6204  She is a typical north Indian women. No patience, Don't even know basics about how to behave in public
Your working for an English customers you suppose try to  learn English. If you working for kanada customer you have to learn it.. what's wrong in it...i did not understand.
If your come from illiterate? then can u understand english
How did you assume that everyone know english?
Then how did you assume that everyone know hindi😅🤣lol keep your mouth shut
No compromise in language matter.
This is just like telling that it is ok for your father to marry again because your mother is infertile...😂
​ @Kong3287 i think your father tried that's why you can find the similarity
​@Kong3287 it's better to marry some else rather than marrying your cousin sister or maternal uncle😂😂😂😂😂😂.Cheeap
None of your business as to why he had an account with SBI. WTF are you to ask?
None of your business as to why he had an account with SBI. WTF are you to ask?
​ @Kong3287 its better to marry someone else outside your infertle family rather than marrying your own cousin sister or maternal uncle😂😂
As a north India, I would say locals should be preferred in public services.
SBI is Kannadigas bank. We have kept thousands of crores in it.
​ @bluntbob6723  Ya.. That is a common sense everyone should have.
You are free to exit from the city, go back to your hometown...
Northern doesn't understand local language. They use Hindi to overcome language barriers.
Your local language is LOCAL. Nobody outside your state wants to speak your local language
 @bluntbob6723  so many languages are out of existence now...CONGRATS NORTHIES
 @Gamer_Boyz_007  THEN GO WITH ENGLISH ,WHO ARE STOPPING YOU
​ @ammaamma-g1h6x Its okay.
इल्ला 😅
Shat UP idli
But, that kannada guy must have irritated her to the point that she became rude in replying
 @cherrytv3 so if she was a doctor and a patient is crying out of pain should the doctor walk away?  It’s tragic that we have sick folks like you in our country who don’t understand customer service.
​ @cherrytv3  customers are first priority
Can't deny that some peopl​e go too far too quickly @ka-oj3oc 
U coming from outside must answer politely​ @cherrytv3 
​@ka-oj3oc it doesn't  mean  you can  cross her  limits
Yaa
"1. They should learn banking. Many prefer engineering.
2. In private/for profit firms don't introduce reservations. It will be like pulling legs down. On any basis. 
3. I believe the non professional employees are localities only."
Look this is the pain point of this lady. Who asked her to come to Karnataka? Now SBI is in a damage control mode. She has also apologised. We don’t care how many languages a person like her should learn? It’s none of our business. We want her to talk in Kannada if we visit her branch. That’s all that we care about. Where she is  transferred to next is none of our business? Secondly don’t you bank employees have the guts to tell as to where you would like to get posted?
Lol atleast she should have said that in a mature manner but she said this is india and I will speak Hindi and you guys support that ? Nice logic.
Why should he go to UP and speak Bhojpuri - Customer is keeping his hard earned money in sbi if he needs some clarification management is responsible to clear his doubt. She is getting a salary because of such a customer.
in that case she could say simply i dont know kannada, please speak with who knows kannada, more over who has given authrity to ask to speak in their own laungage in karnataka... kannada is king in karnataka, marathi is king in maharastra. know that first...
So true .. there are so many local ppl standing to watch the argument but not ready to translate.
If they don't know english or hindi?
Yes it ceases to exist because 99% Muslims of karnataka know kannada...even in hardcore muslim ghettos....they don't disrespect kannada like u chapri norties...we have Muslims who have contributed to our language significantly...we have poets from Muslims who have created beautiful literature works in kannada...yes i am more then happy to speak in urdu with Muslims in karnataka but never hindi with u chapri norties
there are so many SBi banks in North side  go work there why you need to come here
"Lokal language must be spoken where 
the bank is located."
"Customers, this is how the state bank of india manager treat.

She is epitome of arrogance."
Should send her out of office .. they are locals and they don’t know Hindi or English and just coz manager doesn’t know Kannada customers can’t adopt she has to learn to adopt
Good reply by the madam. Why not both speak english
"SBI is Central govt bank. They use official languages of Central govt - English and Hindi.
For Karnataka, they should go to some state level bank like Karnataka bank, or a cooperative bank, or Karnataka govt should open a bank."
The real news is that the SBI manager harassed the locals, she is illiterate enough that she says she won’t speak kannada ever being a bank employee and working in Karnataka. She is unfit to provide service in Karnataka. How respectfully the person is asking, she has the audacity to talk to him like he is her servant. SBI, as a account holder in your bank, this is not the way I require your staff to engage with account holders
Your karnataka bank and canara bank also have branches all over India. People of other state behave like you there what will happen.
Foolish,go to another  bank
Why is Kannadigas doing this to theselves. Kannada has become a joke now. Why do you think not learning your language is disrespecting it. Central gov employees gets transferred all over India every now and then. They cannot learn 1000 languages. They know Hindi and English. Communicate in either of the two languages.
What the hell is wrong with our Country???
I'm from a place where people speak more than 60+ languages, never have i seen people fighting or arguing over which language should be spoken.
Kannadigas are very good people but fanatics like this will spoil the image of Karnataka.
And they call themselves as a literate person😅
Look at her arrogance. North indians troubling every region.
#ChapriNorthies
Dear nonsense CNN what's there to harras.... It's her duty to speak local language.. idiot admin it ll continue, let's see man ,
This sbi manager is harassing the customers by not respecting and speaking in their language.
I love india we support india... If search on Google you found language is Hindi and English ❤
Speak in English. And if you don’t know English, it’s your fault. No regional nonsense in business.
"In banks managers are transferred every 3-5 years.
I can assure a Kannada manager cannot speak Bengali if he posted in Bengal....

You need to give her reasonable time to learn language. Language is not something you can drink from bottle"
Because she has come here to fill her stomach.
Local people will find challenges. That's why.
is this english speaking state. again ur out of box
Then SBI should only transact for people knowing Hindi and English. They should not look for the businesses of other language speaking people of India.
​ @Dillikidastaan SBI doesn't beg people to transact with them. It is customer's choice. Customer is not being forced. I don't even have SBI account. Nobody forced me or anyone.
 @rajx7120 Every bank needs business and needs to give service to customers. SBI has maximum accounts of poor and illiterate people. If they insist on doing business only in English and Hindi, this is am imperial attitude, exactly how the colonial British behaved. It’s a different matter than SBI service is the pits all over the country with some noble exceptions and that’s purely due to the branch managers and local staff.
Don't worry.  That's what happening. The only Hindi speaking states and their people are loosing everything one by one.
 @mahizhnansadayappan3077  They are a vote bank. And happily will remain so.
That's not the point, serving respective language ppl is done effectively by respecive language ppl, if ur Hindi need to talk or service , whom U choose first? Hindi or kanada first?
Rey labbe there are total 22 offical languages in india not only English and Hindi
 @phanindraganta1999 😂😅😅😅😅😂😂😂
Nonsense at its peak. Please read RBI guidelines
Then let SBI close their branches in all non Hindi speaking states.  Have guts?
"​ @rajasekhark8333 Why should they close, when they have customers? Illogical.
Stop going to them. They will close automatically, due to lack of customers. That's called market forces."
"​ @alexanderkrishnadevaraya7719 What Hindi and Kannada? What about English? A Central govt bank is using official languages of Central govt.
Where are the regional banks and cooperative banks? Go there. Ask state govt to start a state level bank just like State level PSUs, and open branches with Kannada as priority. Who is stopping?"
"​​ @rajx7120      If they are looking for customers, then they would need to satisfy customer's needs of servicing them in their local language.  If SBI is capable, then yes.  Else, if they feel they are incapable, they don't deserve to open any branches in non Hindi speaking areas.

But all that is not important.  The important thing is SBI needs to ensure its personnel speak in local language for servicing customers.

Even more importantly, Hindi speakers need to shed their arrogance and make effort to learn local language"
"​ @rajasekhark8333 Banks with centralized recruitment procedures,
may not get people with local language proficiency, that easily. That too with transfer rules, it would be difficult to keep learning languages.
Best solution is, state govt taking matter in its hands, and provide banking services. State govts are not for showpiece, are they?"
​ @rajx7120     Boss, do you understand the point being made?  Bank employees are not the only ones migrating.  Those settling need to learn local language.  What is such a problem in this?  Arrogance of Hindi speakers is the issue today.  That Manager saying she "will never" speak Kannada proves her arrogance.  Don't claim it is very difficult to learn any language.  Within 3 to 6 months, one can learn basic sentences pretty easily.
SBI is not out of India. They should give service in all Indian languages. Because all language people are the customers of it.
​​ @rajasekhark8333  I don't know why most of the hindi people doesn't like to learn other Indian language, though they want to settle in that state. They are disrespecting the Indian languages. They give pose as if they should learn any foreign language.
"​ @srinidhik.p6853    That is what I have been saying too.  Hindi speakers: (1) claim Hindi is national language (it is not);  (2) feel other languages are inferior;  (3) expect others to speak to them in Hindi;  (4) if anyone protests, claim they are dividing the nation.  Arrogance!

Unifying the nation doesn't mean only Hindi should survive and rest of the language can or should die.  Kannadigas are not against Hindi.  Hindi speakers should not be against Kannada, and other local languages"
​ @srinidhik.p6853 SBI is at centre. Centre can't do everything. States are becoming lazy. They should also provide services. Then this problem won't happen.
​ @rajx7120 Hindi is the understood all over the world.
"​ @srinidhik.p6853 Many Hindi people, do learn local language. But not everyone has time and the need to learn that language. It takes many years to learn a language. A person who moved yesterday can't learn.
But this is a different problem from the issue at SBI.
The issue at SBI is, that a national level bank should not be depended for last mile banking. There should be a regional bank for local only needs."
You think Karnataka bank and Canara Bank can do business in North without Hindi. They are adamant that they will learn only Hindi and speak only Hindi.
That's not the point oppointing the local ppl is better to deliver effective service to there local's respectively, Then language barriers will suppressed. If one come from Tamilanadu to Up, will he gives you better service? not at all
Privatize it then we’ll go to some other banks why are you operating the bank with tax payers money?
Foolish go to northern state if you don't know kannada
"Close down the bank in karnataka..
We have so many other banks...

We donot want sbi to operate..
Such a shameless bank...."
Foolish lady doesn't know to learn the regional Indian language.
Even services officers try to speak languages where they  are serving, And respecting ppl. But some Hindi ppl does not try to respect others languages leave about the speaking
​ @alexanderkrishnadevaraya7719 Unwanted Controversies affecting our Culture...If one goes to Dubai for Work,do the Dubai Authority or arab people force them to learn arabic...???.

​@chandrandec31 why would I speak a language that I can't read/write or speak? I'm much comfortable with language I've been speaking forever.
 @tonjingchang7431 good for you. WTF are you or your state that we should emulate?
​ @chandrandec31 atleast he is better than you who lacks d brain to understand that every human cannot speak regional languages or the languages that are spoken worldwide just becos he happens to be born on this earth willingly or unwillingly.😮
​@EshAnian-q5o look at the mentality of yours. If you can't interpret what I meant, it's better off being silent.
60+ ? Which place? Can you explain?
​ @chandrandec31 💯👍
​@santhoshv3028 Nagaland. Though many of the dialects aren't officially recognized.
​ @EshAnian-q5o  Coward Joker.
So tell me which language that 60 people are speaking in common?
No use its waste of time talking to this people thay wont understand  ​@tonjingchang7431
​ @tonjingchang7431  but still you have one common language nagamese right? So no problem. But here there is no common language yet decided. That's where problem going.
 @santhoshv3028 the common language in Karnataka is Kannada. What are you talking about?
​ @EshAnian-q5o  I Said for other reply. I am not talking about Karnataka alone. I spoke about whole India's
Absolutely right
If you are in a job that's related to customer interaction and refuse to interact with local language, and once you speak against it it becomes fanaticism what kind of world we live in.
So Kannadigas should bootlick irrespective of anything to be nice.
"The bank is meant to serve customers . learning the language where they serve customer is basic thing ..even if they can't speak , atleast should be polite ..

she knows kannada then why can't she speak in kannada with kannada speaking Customer ..she can't expect her customer to learn English or Hindi to use Bank services"
"The bank is meant to serve customers . learning the language where they serve customer is basic thing ..even if they can't speak , atleast should be polite ..

she knows kannada then why can't she speak in kannada with kannada speaking Customer ..she can't expect her customer to learn English or Hindi to use Bank services"
what fanaticism ?? Hindi must be banned in Non-Hindi States. Then only these Hindi imposers will learn  a lesson.
Here the bank manager is the fanatic who refuses to speak in no language other than Hindi. Must be Amit Shah fan.
Image of Kannadiga to whom ... ? you think the kannadiga care about the biharis and UPs think about them ? hahahaa...
"​ @kircyclone  other states people coming to Karnataka to earn their livelihood and flourishing here without even learning local language.

We dont need to care of other states people individually ..we are 3rd largest tax paying state to center .which they are using to build nation including states you mentioned in your comments .

Educate yourselves and learn to respect all language ."
" @jyothin9133   those live at karnataka without knowing kannada are not bank employees... they are not in a position to interact with local people on daily basis...

But the bank employees like cashier are supposed to respect the people who they serve and they get their salary serving the locals.

when the south indians go to north india and learn hindi to work there why cant the North indians learn the local language when they come and work in the south ?"
"​ @kircyclone that  only I am saying . No need to care for any other state and learn their language  ..we are caring for them enough by paying the 3rd highest tax .

Instead of blaming the manager for behaving rudely with the customer and demanding the customer to speak in Hindi , many are scolding Karnataka and kannadigas .. commonsense less people ."
If your definition of "good people image" is the one that comes by not supporting Kannadigas who doesnt get services in Kannada when they are in Karnataka then you keep your definition of that image with yourself 😂..
No. Kannadiga people are not good people.
"This bank lady isnilloterate shows her sense 😂😂😂😂
She will be fired from job"
But video shows kanadda bloody chapri mentality
​ @sachinyadav-im1rj  I clearly mentioned "chapri" northies and your comment proving yourself a chapri.... First delete 😂😂😂
​ @Pradeepkumar-fb9zp you are certificate giver?I dnt need your certificate you provoked first shows your mentality
Not correct! Ask them to learn language to communicate with locals.
Are u all mad ,She is a central employee she will get transfer in 2 year how can she learn ?,Think clearly man ,working 10 hrs and learning kannada ,is this good? Can u all learn all 22+ languages bcz u are central employee?
"SBI is Central govt bank. They use English and Hindi. You want Kannada, then go to Karnataka bank or some co-operative bank.
Or learn English."
"​ @rajx7120 ok good. Then remove sbi from karnataka.  They will use state bank of mysore.

Don't give stupid reasons,  doesn't matter it is central or something else.

Let them use internally not with the customers. 

First understand upto where those official languages are limited,  Don't speak lijexa half knowledge fellow. 

Remove all the govt support and rbi support from sbi."
​Are you anti national bot your ridiculous comment is everywhere idiot😂😂😂 nobody wants your choice ​ @srijagadeeshc3056 
"​​ @srijagadeeshc3056 You are giving stupid excuse. How is SBI presence harming Kannada or anyone? Don't go there.
Go to some other bank, where they have Kannada. So many banks are there. Anybody force you to keep account in SBI? No.
Unnecessary drama."
​ @srijagadeeshc3056  How about Pakistani bank does Karnataka needs that state bank will ran away from your stupidity decision 🤡🤡🤡
Iam from Karnataka, I Love India ❤️ I don't know Hindi & I will never learn Hindi because Kannada is our official language of our State karnataka
Nobody ask that ​ @SangeetaS-qb6rx 
Yes stop hindi imposition.
​ @srijagadeeshc3056  She was speaking in English. Are you dumb ?
Language should be a bridge not barrier.
India first hindi first
Not worthy of it being a news. Karnataka ppl why u sending kids in cbse, icse school? Send to Kannada medium school let them at least learn Kannada. And please don’t teach them other languages. Because the schools are in karnataka 😂😂😂 many kannadiga kids don’t even know to read kannada.
"“Kannada firstu madam”
Has two English words in it! 😂"
This is virus getting injected in human species by manipulation! The person who is fighting because he affected by influencer around him
Speak in English & hindi....just fu*k local languages. Banned local language everywhere
These karnataka people are crazy
This is stupidity
Not sure why kannadigas are frantic about only kannada in Karnataka, is it something incited by congis
"Apne Mobile me to english language hoti hai 

Apne vehicle ki number plate english me hoti hai 

Medicines k nam bhi english me hote hai

What an idiot, he insists kannada by creating regional differences rather than allegiance to country. Also speaks English but can't talk in Hindi. IDIOT.
Poora desh hmara chutiyape mai vileen ho chuka hai....
Get lost SBI team. When you are in the south speak in the local language Or else speak in English you damn..
Vattaal Nagarajan what doing there

IF IT'S A BRIDGE THEN IT'S YOUR FUCKING JOB TO CROSS IT. NOT OURS. IF YOU WANT TO COME TO KARNATAKA. CROSS THAT BRIDGE YOURSELF. AND MAKE SURE YOU TAKE A BATH BEFORE YOU COME HERE. YOU GUYS SMELL LIKE FUCKING CURRY
Created by politicians for their benefits
 @lakshmisrinivasan7066  practiced by us like fools
Then try to speak and respect regional language so no problem
"Manager must have Basic skills how to handle. 
SBI must be Privatetised"
Precisely. Language should be a bridge and in Karnataka that bridge is Kannada.
Modern trend is create a language war and politicise the issue and gain more viewership . Why is he filming this 😂😂😂 .
​​ @EshAnian-q5o that bridge does not take u anywhere unless u have more inventions in kannada language. Just speaking a kannada language does not ensure the growth of kannadaa or kaanadigaas. 😂😂i am a tamil and i face many situation like this in tamilnadu where people politicise this issue .our people have died for our language few decades back protesting against hindi imposition
 @joylife428 read my sentence completely. I am saying the bridge in Karnataka is Kannada. Of course English is there. Why worry about other languages? Inventions don’t come from language but from science math and visualisation.
​ @EshAnian-q5o yes. My whole point is if a language does not bring out social values in science engineering lifestyle of people it will die automatically. 😂 Using a language only for communication does not take the language forward
​ @gajananbhat3474  acha
" @joylife428 life does not centre just around your profession. One needs entertainment sense of belonging and attachment to his(her) roots and that comes from mother tongue. 

Now as far as this case is concerned thus is about customer service and the manager is in customer facing . Okay she did not know the language but she could have solicited help from her staff or other colleagues. She did not understand the basic tenet of customer service which 

1. The customer is always right
2. If the customer has a wrong ho to Rule 1.


This is not about language but about management skills and customer service. 

I used to manage 1500 customer service people under me. Any such behaviour meant immediate dismissal. 

In manufacturing we have what is  called as Quarterly business reviews (QBR)  and one only needs to see how we multinational companies are treated by the customer. The customers will scream and use 4 letter words. I come from that background. So keep your stupid philosophy between your 2 legs.

Language breeds through communication. Words like maccha guru all came from spoken language only."
We agree with you! But try to advice your manager and also those officials refuse to communicate in regional languages and arrogant towards common peoples who don't know Hindi and English!
​ @chethusetty_chethu the manager did not force hindi on the customer. The customer wanted to make a video of it to create a controversy. He was forcing the manager to talk in kannada. 😂 The manager refused because she does not know .
"​ @joylife428  what's your problem!? Manager or any public servant should learn regional languages to serve local citizens!

Not everyone smart like you!
 If you want you can communicate in Chinese,.... it's your problem!! for that you want go chaina!"
​​ @chethusetty_chethu thats in government institutions . Not in private companies or private sector.i understand that the state government should enforce the kannada language in courts government institutions and schools and colleges. But disagree with u in private sector enforcement. 😂language is not a barrier in 21st century.
​ @joylife428 Any company serving for common peoples irrespective of government sector or private sector should give service in regional language.
​​ @chethusetty_chethu i strongly oppose it. Private sectors recruit people from other states also to do labour works . So cant enforce a language on those people who r already illiterate and they have no connection with local people . Thats against human right of freedom of speech in their language
​ @joylife428  ಮಂಗನ ತುಲ್ಲೆ! ಅರ್ಥ ಆಗಿಲ್ಲ ಅಂದ್ರೆ ತಿಕ್ಕ ಮುಚ್ಕೊಂಡಿರು!
But karnataka people think that they are different country apart from india
You know everything right shut your *
Simple all the cbse icse teach only kannada language remove useless hindi.
"​ @srijagadeeshc3056 
So, you are saying, state govt is useless. They can't spend on quality education to teach even Kannada. Spend all the money on freebies only."
"​ @rajx7120  are idiot read it properly,  it is the central government imposing hindi boondi.

Ofcourse state gov is wasting in freebies."
 @srijagadeeshc3056 Why depend on CBSE board for education? And why the kannadiga children has to be taught a foreign language like English? Looks like kannadiga hate only Hindi?
"​ @sumalathas7039  you have to be explained in a book. Few sentences are not enough?

Is English foreign?  So as hindi is foreign to south indians.

I am telugu, hindi foreign to me and hindi one north regional language like ours.

I am in bengaluru learned and speaking in kannada.

Thr bank manager is not illiterate right, she can learn.

If cbse don't want to do in karnataka and south tgey can walk away, we don't mind."
 @srijagadeeshc3056  Did you learn kannada in a day? What do you mean by the SBI officer is literate? Literate means the person can read and write, that doesnt mean that they can easily read and write in Kannada.  Bank employees get transferred in multiple states across India, Not based on any criteria that they should be able to read and write in local language.    Did you learn Kannada by choice or someone imposed on you?   Please understand you cant impose language on anyone just because they are working in Karnataka. In that way, Can you ask all the millionaires and billionares  who have invested, worked and setup offices in Bengaluru to speak Kannada and ask them to leave Karnataka?? If so why this language love happening now, It should have happened 30 years before. Then the Bengaluru would have remained without any development.   This City have embraced multi culturalism. Now when they are getting the fruits, some people want to do politics based on language for votes, because election is coming. I hope this is understood clearly.
That was for the benefit of that idiotic woman.
That is what. She won't speak even English. She is telling She will speak only Hindi. She must be Don Quixote and Shahncho Panza fan. By the way, I am a BJP supporter who opposes Hindi imposition by Shahncho Panza.
"Have some sense, nobody asking you to speak in pure ansecstral form of language. 
Giving the banking service in regional language is the RBI policy."
​ @chandrandec31 Saar
​ @chandrandec31 I think you are Sancho Panza becos you happen to be a supporter of BJP and you are going against their policy of imposing hindi all over India 😊
and the third is a proper noun
Good observation
Cause she doesn't know kannada
😂😂
He is helping her to make her understand and doing a favor
So what ,as we don't want to speak Hindi we might speak any language other than hindi
Hindi is full of izlamik persian
​ @francisbacon6920  History has left Youtube after reading your comment bro. Go and read about the dynastic party and their policy through which they wanted to impose hindi long before 2014.
​ @ritamdebnath5728 dear gobernath how is your lotus party different from the dynastic party whose history you are well-versed with and why is it that your lotus party always follow their footsteps? History has not left YouTube as your lotus party is continuing the same polices that became history by your dynastic party 😊
​ @francisbacon6920  Dear Baygon spray, I can understand your frustration. Stay strong. Don't lose hope.
​ @ritamdebnath5728  the spray in me has frustrated you as you have lost hope and  can't remain strong anymore 😊
